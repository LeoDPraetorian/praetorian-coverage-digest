# Microcontroller Exploits

**Comprehensive guide to extracting firmware and secrets from microcontrollers through memory extraction, debugger attacks, privilege escalation, fault injection, and invasive techniques.**

## When to Use This Skill

Use this skill when:

- Extracting firmware from protected microcontrollers (STM32, nRF, PIC, LPC, MSP430)
- Bypassing read protection (RDP, APPROTECT, code protection fuses)
- Exploiting bootloader vulnerabilities (DFU, USB recovery modes)
- Performing JTAG/SWD debugging attacks (gadgets in ROM, word leaks)
- Conducting fault injection and voltage glitching
- Decapsulating chips and performing UV erasure
- Photographing mask ROMs for firmware extraction
- Understanding microcontroller security architectures
- Researching embedded device security and hardware hacking

**This skill provides access to the complete text of Microcontroller Exploits (No Starch Press).**
