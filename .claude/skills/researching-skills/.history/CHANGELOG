## 2025-12-31 - Initial Creation

### RED Phase (Gap Documentation)
- **Problem**: Existing `researching-skills` library skill is a hybrid - not a pure router
- **Failures identified**:
  - Implements Context7 and Web research inline instead of delegating
  - Inconsistent delegation pattern (some skills delegated, others inline)
  - No user prompt for source selection (user has no control)
  - No persistent output (research disappears after session)
  - Web treated as fallback instead of primary source

### Creation Details
- **Location**: Core skill (`.claude/skills/`)
- **Type**: Process/Router (pure delegation pattern)
- **Purpose**: Orchestrate research across 5 specialized methods with user control

### Features
- Pure router pattern - delegates to 5 specialized library skills
- User-controlled source selection via AskUserQuestion (multiSelect)
- Smart recommendations based on context clue detection
- Sequential execution of selected research workflows
- Mandatory synthesis of findings (SYNTHESIS.md)
- Persistent output to `.claude/research/{timestamp}-{topic}/`
- TodoWrite tracking for all phases

### Specialized Skills (Library)
1. `researching-codebase` - Local pattern discovery
2. `researching-context7` - npm/library official docs
3. `researching-github` - Open-source repos, code, issues
4. `researching-arxiv` - Academic papers
5. `researching-web` - Blogs, tutorials, Stack Overflow

### Reference Files
- `references/synthesis-template.md` - SYNTHESIS.md template
- `references/recommendation-logic.md` - Keyword detection patterns
- `references/output-structure.md` - File organization details
