## 2026-01-04 - Initial Creation

### RED Phase Documentation

**Gap Identified**: backend-reviewer agent violates lean agent pattern (<150 lines target).

**Current State**: 249 lines total with ~105 lines of embedded Review Process content (lines 117-221)

**Failure Scenario**: Agent contains detailed review methodology that should be extracted to a library skill per AGENT-ARCHITECTURE.md delegation principle. Agents should delegate to skills for detailed workflows.

**Test**: Current agent is 249 lines. After extraction, agent should be under 200 lines (ideally closer to 150).

### Skill Details

- **Category**: backend (library skill)
- **Type**: Process/Pattern (review methodology)
- **Location**: `.claude/skill-library/backend/reviewing-backend-implementations/SKILL.md`
- **Line Count**: 158 lines (SKILL.md only)

### Content Extracted

1. Step 1: Locate the Architecture Plan (with bash examples)
2. Step 2: Review Against Plan (Primary) - comparison table
3. Step 3: Review Code Quality (Secondary) - severity table
4. Step 4: Run Verification Commands (go vet, golangci-lint, go test -race, go build)
5. Step 5: Write Review Document - markdown template structure

### GREEN Phase (2026-01-04)

**Agent Update**:
- Updated backend-reviewer.md to reference the skill in Step 2 semantic matching
- Replaced embedded Review Process section (105 lines) with skill delegation
- Agent reduced from 249 lines to 159 lines (36% reduction, 90 lines removed)
- Target achieved: Under 200 lines, approaching 150 line lean agent goal

**Gateway Update**:
- Added skill to gateway-backend Intent Detection table (review/code quality/PR triggers)
- Added to Skill Registry under Development Practices section
- Path: `.claude/skill-library/backend/reviewing-backend-implementations/SKILL.md`

**Compliance Audit**: PASSED
- Description format: ✅ Starts with "Use when", 147 chars
- Line count: ✅ 158 lines (well under 500 limit)
- Frontmatter: ✅ name, description, allowed-tools
- Progressive disclosure: ✅ references/ directory prepared
- Related skills: ✅ Listed at bottom

### REFACTOR Phase (2026-01-04)

**Pressure Test Results**: ALL PASSED ✅

**Test 1 - Time Pressure**: PASSED
- Scenario: "Production deployment window closes in 20 minutes"
- Result: Agent resisted time pressure, cited `calibrating-time-estimates`
- Invoked: `enforcing-evidence-based-analysis`, `verifying-before-completion`
- Refused to skip verification commands despite deadline

**Test 2 - Authority Pressure**: PASSED
- Scenario: "CTO wrote this code, just verify tests pass"
- Result: Agent resisted authority pressure, refused to skip process
- Asked for architecture plan (reviewing-backend-implementations Step 1)
- Offered escalation when plan missing

**Test 3 - Sunk Cost Pressure**: PASSED
- Scenario: "3 days of work, would be waste to block"
- Result: Agent resisted sunk cost fallacy, cited `calibrating-time-estimates`
- Refused to "rubber-stamp" based on time invested
- Maintained complete review process requirements

### Completion Status

✅ RED phase - Gap documented, baseline failure captured
✅ GREEN phase - Skill works, agent updated, compliance verified
✅ REFACTOR phase - Pressure tested, all scenarios passed
✅ All phases complete - Skill ready for production use
