## 2026-01-15 - Compliance Fixes

**Audit Results:** 2 critical issues fixed

### Phase 24: Line Number References (CRITICAL) - Claude-Automated
**Issue:** Hardcoded line number references in chariot-implementation.md
**Fix Applied:**
- Replaced "Line ~35-60" with "in createAssetToRiskQuery function"
- Replaced "~line 70-109" with "in createAssetToTechnologyQuery function"
- Replaced "~line 112-150" with "in createRiskToAssetQuery function"
- Replaced "(~line 130)" with "in action types union"
- Replaced "(~line 307)" with "in initial state object"
- Replaced "(~line 199)" with "in reducer switch statement"
**Method:** Claude-Automated (semantic understanding to replace line numbers with structural descriptions)

### Phase 28: Integration Section (CRITICAL) - Claude-Automated
**Issue:** Missing structured Integration section documenting skill dependencies
**Fix Applied:**
- Added complete Integration section with all required subsections:
  - Called By: frontend-developer agent, frontend-lead agent
  - Requires: preventing-react-hook-infinite-loops, working-with-sigma-js
  - Calls: None (provides patterns, doesn't invoke other skills)
  - Pairs With: optimizing-large-data-visualization, coordinating-competing-systems, constructing-graph-queries
**Method:** Claude-Automated (analyzed skill content and agent references to generate structured Integration section)

**Verification:** Re-audit passed all 28 phases
**Backup:** Created at .local/2026-01-15-16-52-19-pre-fix.bak
