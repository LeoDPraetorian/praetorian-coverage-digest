# Q2FY26 Roadmap

[ Back to Overview](../OVERVIEW.md)

**Theme: Launch ASM Community Edition**

In the final quarter of the fiscal year, we leverage our mature, enterprise-grade platform to launch two major strategic initiatives that will define our market position. First, we establish a significant market presence and data-acquisition flywheel by launching a public Community Edition of Attack Surface Management capabilities. Second, we pioneer the next frontier of offensive AI by building foundational R&D capabilities for autonomous Zero-Day vulnerability discovery.

## Quarter Status: Planned (Future Work)

This quarter's work is future-planned. Several critical initiatives depend on prerequisites that are not yet implemented.

| Initiative                 | Status  | Blocking Dependencies                                         |
| -------------------------- | ------- | ------------------------------------------------------------- |
| ASM Community Edition      | Planned | -                                                             |
| BAS Module                 | Planned | -                                                             |
| Zero-Day Discovery         | Planned | **Requires HPTSA pattern (not built)**, SageMaker ML pipeline |
| Advanced Intelligence (RL) | Planned | Requires SageMaker ML pipeline                                |

**Critical Note**: Zero-Day Discovery requires the HPTSA (Hierarchical Planning and Task-Specific Agents) pattern which is NOT implemented. The current agent is a single ReAct agent, not a hierarchical multi-agent team.

## Breach & Attack Simulation Planned

Build out a full-featured BAS module by integrating with major EDRs and SIEMs to correlate attack actions with observed defensive outcomes. Deliver MITRE ATT&CK and D3FEND-aligned dashboards for visualizing offensive and defensive coverage.

### Requirements

| REQ ID      | Requirement                                     | Rationale                                                                                         | Status |
| ----------- | ----------------------------------------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- | ------ |
| REQ-BAS-001 | EDR & SIEM Integration for Detection Monitoring | Connect to CrowdStrike, MS Defender, SentinelOne, Splunk APIs; ingest alerts and logs             |        |
| REQ-BAS-002 | Detection Correlation Engine                    | Unique correlation_id tagging; link TaskRecords to security events; normalize to defense outcomes |        |
| REQ-BAS-003 | MITRE ATT&CK Mapping                            | Add mitre_attack_ttp field to Agora schema; map capabilities to ATT&CK techniques                 |        |
| REQ-BAS-004 | MITRE D3FEND Mapping                            | Map defense actions to D3FEND framework techniques                                                |        |
| REQ-UI-015  | Interactive Attack Path Visualization           | Overlay correlated detection status (undetected/alerted/blocked) on each attack step              |        |
| REQ-UI-016  | MITRE ATT&CK Coverage Navigator                 | Full ATT&CK matrix with color-coded TTPs by availability, testing status, detection status        |        |
| REQ-UI-017  | MITRE D3FEND Coverage Navigator                 | D3FEND matrix showing triggered countermeasures and defensive gaps                                |        |

### Detection Correlation Engine Architecture

1. Tag all outbound Chariot actions with unique `correlation_id`
2. Process ingested EDR/SIEM logs, searching for correlation IDs
3. Link Chariot TaskRecord to external security events
4. Normalize to structured defense outcomes:
   - **Logged**: Action recorded but not alerted
   - **Alerted**: Security alert generated
   - **Blocked**: Action prevented from completing
   - **Prevented**: Pre-emptive block before execution

### Dashboard Descriptions

**ATT&CK Coverage Navigator**: Strategic at-a-glance view showing:

- Full ATT&CK matrix with available TTPs
- Color coding by: Available in Chariot / Tested / Historical detection status
- Helps operators plan assessments and track defense improvements

**D3FEND Coverage Navigator**: Blue Team view showing:

- Which defensive techniques were successfully triggered
- Effective controls highlighted
- Defensive gaps where countermeasures were expected but did not fire

## Zero Day Discovery Planned (Blocked)

With the core platform for N-day vulnerabilities established, officially launch R&D into using AI to discover novel, zero-day vulnerabilities. This initiative moves beyond simple attack execution into true machine-driven security research.

**CRITICAL BLOCKER**: This initiative requires the HPTSA (Hierarchical Planning and Task-Specific Agents) pattern which is NOT implemented. The current implementation has a single ReAct agent using AWS Bedrock + Claude. There is no hierarchical multi-agent orchestration, no specialized sub-agents (SQLi, XSS, Zero-Day specialists), and no supervisor agent pattern.

### The Hunt for Zero-Days

Build foundational elements of this new paradigm:

- Hierarchical team of specialized agents (HPTSA model) - **NOT BUILT**
- AI-driven vulnerability hypothesis generation - Planned
- Logic to synthesize complex findings from disparate test results - Planned

### Requirements

| REQ ID       | Requirement                      | Rationale                                                                                            | Status         |
| ------------ | -------------------------------- | ---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- | -------------- |
| REQ-ZDAY-001 | Zero-Day Discovery Agent Team    | Hierarchical team following HPTSA pattern (research: Zhu et al. 2025)                                | Requires HPTSA |
| REQ-ZDAY-002 | Hypothesis Generation Capability | Formulate vulnerability hypotheses from recon data; systematic testing (research: Fang et al. 2024a) |                |
| REQ-ZDAY-003 | Vulnerability Class Expertise    | Specialized agents for SQLi, XSS, SSRF, etc.; dispatched by supervisor agents                        | Requires HPTSA |
| REQ-ZDAY-004 | Finding Synthesis                | Correlate and synthesize multiple test results into coherent vulnerability findings                  |                |

### HPTSA Pattern (Hierarchical Planning and Task-Specific Agents)

**Structure for Zero-Day Discovery**:

- **Supervisor Agent**: Coordinates overall discovery strategy, assigns tasks, synthesizes findings
- **Reconnaissance Agent**: Maps attack surface comprehensively
- **Hypothesis Generation Agent**: Formulates potential vulnerability theories
- **Specialized Testing Agents**: Domain experts for specific vulnerability classes
- **Verification Agent**: Validates potential findings before reporting

**Research Basis**: Zhu et al. (2025) demonstrates significantly higher success rates for zero-day discovery using specialized agent teams.

## Advanced Intelligence Planned

| REQ ID        | Requirement                                                    | Rationale                                                                                                | Status             |
| ------------- | -------------------------------------------------------------- | -------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- | ------------------ |
| REQ-AGENT-015 | Incorporate Reinforcement Learning for Adaptive Agent Training | RL frameworks for rewarding successful attack paths; self-play scenarios; fine-tune on RL-generated data | Requires SageMaker |

### Reinforcement Learning Details

Integrate RL techniques into learning loops:

- Reward agents for successful attack paths (via Attack Graph Progress)
- Penalties for failures or inefficiencies
- Self-play scenarios (agent vs. agent) in controlled benchmarks (CybORG, Vulnhub)
- Fine-tune proprietary models on RL-generated data with HITL oversight
- Track improvements via Transfer Learning Improvement metrics

**Impact**: Addresses LLM agent struggles with adaptation to novel threats. Research (ACM June 2025, Vectra.ai RedTeamLLM) demonstrates RL potential for recursive planning and autonomous systems. Enables agents to learn from failures for robust offensive security.
