# Phase 6: Brainstorming

**Design refinement with human-in-loop (LARGE work type only).**

---

## When to Use

Only for LARGE work types:
- Complex protocols with multiple auth methods
- Plugins requiring KeyPlugin interface
- Novel authentication patterns

---

## Process

1. Invoke `brainstorming` skill
2. Explore design alternatives
3. Get human approval on approach
4. Document decisions

---

## Output

Create `brainstorming.md` with:
- Design alternatives considered
- Trade-offs analyzed
- Selected approach with rationale
- Human approval recorded
