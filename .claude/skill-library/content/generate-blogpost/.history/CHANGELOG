## 2026-01-26 - Offensive Tool Post Guidance

**Source**: User feedback comparing AI-generated draft with manually edited version for Silbannacus tool announcement.

**Added to SKILL.md**:
- New "Domain-Specific Guidance" section
- "Offensive Security Tool Posts" subsection with 7 principles:
  1. Operational Model > Implementation Details
  2. Kill "Completeness" Sections
  3. Frame Through Attacker Lens
  4. Memorable Examples > Generic Ones
  5. Include Practitioner Tips
  6. Connect to Contemporary Techniques
  7. End Clean

**Added to references/anti-patterns.md**:
- 6 new offensive tool anti-patterns (#11-16):
  - Implementation Over Operations
  - Obligatory Sections
  - Generic Framing
  - Forgettable Examples
  - Missing Field Knowledge
  - Forced Closing Humor

**Added to references/content-synthesis.md**:
- "Offensive Tool Posts: Operational Framing" section
- Attacker/Defender asymmetry articulation
- Operational model narrative examples
- Section necessity test
- Contemporary technique integration

**Key insight**: AI drafts tend toward "completeness" (use cases, security considerations, implementation details) that practitioners don't need. Manual edits consistently removed these sections and added operational/attacker-focused framing instead.
