# TDD Validation: 3 Code Reviewers + receiving-code-review

**Date**: 2025-11-19
**THE IRONY**: Code reviewers lacked code review skills

## RED: Reviewers accept feedback blindly (no rigor)
## GREEN: MANDATORY receiving-code-review prevents blind implementation
## REFACTOR: Validated - Reviewers apply same rigor they expect

Agents: go-code-reviewer, react-code-reviewer, general-code-reviewer
All updated with identical MANDATORY section.
Per writing-agents methodology.
