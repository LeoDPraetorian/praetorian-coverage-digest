# Changelog - mocking-chariot-task

## [Date: 2025-12-16]

### Changed
- Added "Test Doubles Terminology" section clarifying that mock collectors are technically **Fakes** per Martin Fowler's taxonomy (working implementations with shortcuts, not true Mocks)
- Added "Testing Failure Modes" section with comprehensive examples for:
  - HTTP error responses (500, 404, 429)
  - Timeout handling
  - Empty responses
  - Malformed JSON data
  - Unexpected data structures
  - CLI command failures
  - Test assertions for error scenarios

### Reason
- Missing guidance on testing error conditions and failure scenarios
- Terminology clarification needed to distinguish between Fakes (what we have) and Mocks (behavior verification)
- Developers need examples of how to test edge cases and error handling in capabilities
- Current skill only showed "happy path" testing patterns

### Line Count
- Before: 205 lines
- After: 311 lines
- Still within safe zone (<350 lines)

### REFACTOR
- Tests run: [Time pressure + Sunk cost, Authority pressure + Pragmatism]
- Scenario 1: Agent chose to implement failure tests despite dinner plans (PASSED)
- Scenario 2: Agent pushed back on testify/mock, cited collector pattern (PASSED)
- All tests: PASSED
- Counter-rationalizations added: None needed (skill resisted all pressure scenarios)
