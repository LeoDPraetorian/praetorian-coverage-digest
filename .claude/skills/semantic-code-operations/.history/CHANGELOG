   - Added complete Integration section with four required subsections:
     - Called By: Developer agents (frontend/backend/capability/python)
     - Requires: None (entry point router)
     - Calls: mcp-tools-serena (LIBRARY) with full path
     - Pairs With: gateway-mcp-tools, debugging-systematically
   - Migrated "Related Skills and Tools" to structured Integration format
   - Created separate "Related Documentation" section for non-skill resources

3. **Phase 30: Skill Reference Invocation** (WARNING → PASS)
