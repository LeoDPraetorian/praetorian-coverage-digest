## 2025-12-13 - Agent vs Skill Description Patterns

**Problem**: Phase 4.1 didn't clarify that agent descriptions follow different patterns than skill descriptions, leading to verbose agent descriptions that dilute agent selection effectiveness.

**Solution**: Added comprehensive clarification section in Phase 4.1:
- Added "Agent Descriptions vs Skill Descriptions" comparison table
- Clarified purpose: Skills for search discovery (keyword matching) vs Agents for selection (task type matching)
- Added character count guidance specific to agents:
  - Ideal: 80-100 chars (trigger phrase)
  - Acceptable: 100-150 chars
  - Warning: 150-200 chars
  - Problem: >200 chars
- Updated validation rules with trigger phrase-specific warnings
- Added examples of good vs bad agent descriptions
- Emphasized agents need action-oriented summaries, not verbose explanations

**Files Modified**:
- `references/configuration-rules.md` - Added Agent vs Skill description comparison and updated validation rules

**Impact**: Agents will now have more concise, scannable descriptions that improve Claude's agent selection accuracy.
