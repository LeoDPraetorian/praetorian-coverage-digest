## [2026-01-17] - Documentation Update for 57 Exported Wrappers

### Added
- **Cycles Section** (4 wrappers): create-cycle, get-cycle, list-cycles, update-cycle - now exported
- **Documents Section** (4 wrappers): create-document, get-document, list-documents, update-document - now exported
- **Issue Relations Section** (3 wrappers): create-issue-relation, list-issue-relations, delete-issue-relation - now exported

### Changed
- Updated frontmatter description to reflect 57 exported wrappers (was 45)
- Updated frontmatter description to include cycles, documents, and issue relations
- Updated "Wrappers Exist But Not Exported" section:
  - Removed Cycles (4 wrappers) - now exported
  - Removed Documents (4 wrappers) - now exported
  - Removed Issue Relations (3 wrappers) - now exported
  - Removed delete-project (1 wrapper) - now exported
  - Now only contains: Roadmaps (4 wrappers) and Special utilities (3 wrappers)
  - Total reduced from 19 to 7 unexported wrappers
- Added Roadmaps to "Linear APIs We Don't Wrap Yet" section (wrappers exist but not in index.ts yet)

### Verified
- All 57 wrappers exported in index.ts match documentation
- All 7 unexported wrappers (roadmaps, special utilities) still accurate

### Context
- Cycles, Documents, Issue Relations, and delete-project were implemented and exported in index.ts

## [2026-01-17] - Document description vs content Field Distinction for Linear Projects

### Added
- **"Understanding Project Description vs Content" section** documenting two distinct text fields:
  - `description` (NON_NULL) - Short summary/tagline for project cards and lists
  - `content` (String) - Full markdown content for Project Overview tab
- API field type documentation from GraphQL introspection
- "When to Use Each Field" guidance
- Anti-pattern example (WRONG vs RIGHT usage)
- Content truncation behavior documentation:
  - `get-project`: content truncated to 1000 chars by default
  - `list-projects`: content truncated to 500 chars by default
  - `fullContent: true` parameter to get untruncated content
- Project template `templateData` JSON structure guidance
- **Usage Examples:**
  - "Get Project with Full Content" example showing `fullContent: true` parameter
  - "Create Project with Description and Content" example showing both fields

### Changed
- Updated Projects table Key Parameters:
  - `get-project`: Added `fullContent` (optional, default: false)
  - `list-projects`: Added `fullContent` (optional, default: false)

### Context
- Wrappers `get-project.ts` and `list-projects.ts` were updated to expose `content` field
- Both wrappers now have `fullContent` parameter for truncation control
- This documentation update closes the gap preventing users from knowing about the `content` field
- Prevents anti-pattern of putting full markdown in `description` field

- Updated "Linear APIs We Don't Wrap Yet" section to only include Custom Views, Notifications, Webhooks, and Time Tracking

### Verified
- All 45 wrappers exported in index.ts match documentation
- All 19 unexported wrappers (cycles, documents, roadmaps, issue relations, special wrappers) still accurate

### Context
- These wrappers were implemented and exported in index.ts but not yet documented in the skill
- This update brings documentation in sync with actual exports
