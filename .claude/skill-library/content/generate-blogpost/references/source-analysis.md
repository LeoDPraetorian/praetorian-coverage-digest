# Source Analysis - Understanding the Project

**Goal**: Understand the tool/project deeply enough to explain accurately.

## Entry Point Discovery

1. **README Analysis**: Purpose, features, usage, limitations
2. **Documentation Survey**: CHANGELOG, contributing, examples, API docs
3. **Source Structure**: Main entry point, core modules, component interaction

## Technical Analysis Patterns

### CLI Tools
Trace: command parsing → main operation → output → errors

### Libraries
Analyze: API surface → configuration → extension points → error handling

### Services
Map: endpoints → validation → business logic → responses → errors

## Concept Extraction

Identify 3-5 core concepts that:
- Require explanation to understand tool
- Represent key technical insights
- Make approach unique
- Users need to know to use effectively

Document each:
- What it is
- Why it matters
- How it works
- User impact

## Implementation Details Worth Highlighting

Look for:
- Novel approaches or techniques
- Clever solutions to problems
- Unexpected uses of existing technology
- Ugly-but-necessary hacks
