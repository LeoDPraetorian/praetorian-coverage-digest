# Changelog

## 2026-01-04 - Compliance Fixes: Description, Tools, Table Formatting

**What changed:**
- Phase 1: Condensed description from 371 chars to 249 chars for better readability
- Phase 2: Removed unused `Bash` tool from allowed-tools (skill uses only Go code examples)
- Phase 14: Verified table formatting with Prettier (already compliant)

**Method:**
- Claude-Automated (Phase 1 description condensation)
- Deterministic (Phase 2 tool removal)
- Deterministic (Phase 14 table formatting verification)

**Why:** Audit identified minor compliance issues. Description was comprehensive but overly long. Bash tool was unnecessary since skill contains only Go code examples, not bash commands.

**Line count:** 475 (no change, already under 500-line limit)

**Verification:**
- Description maintains all key terms (errgroup, patterns, TruffleHog, Nuclei, benchmarks, anti-patterns)
- Semantic meaning preserved while improving conciseness
- Gateway membership confirmed in gateway-backend routing table
- All structural validation phases pass

## 2026-01-01 - Production Examples, Semaphore Cross-Reference, Performance Benchmarks

**What changed:**
- Added Pattern 7: Stage-Specific Worker Counts (TruffleHog pattern)
- Added Production Examples section with TruffleHog and Nuclei real-world usage
- Added Performance Benchmarks table comparing sequential, errgroup, and worker pool patterns
- Added errgroup vs Semaphore cross-reference in Decision Guide
- Extracted Anti-Patterns to references/anti-patterns.md (7 patterns)
- Extracted Advanced Patterns to references/advanced-patterns.md (3 patterns)
- Condensed API Reference from detailed sections to compact table
- Condensed Quality Checklist to 3-line format
- Updated References section with TruffleHog, Nuclei, and research documents

**Line count:** 615 → 473 (142 lines saved, now well under 500-line limit)

**Why:** Enrich skill with production scanner patterns from 24K+ star projects (TruffleHog, Nuclei), add cross-references to new semaphore skill, provide performance benchmarks for choosing patterns. Progressive disclosure via references/ keeps SKILL.md lean.

**Sources:**
- TruffleHog GitHub: https://github.com/trufflesecurity/trufflehog
- Nuclei GitHub: https://github.com/projectdiscovery/nuclei
- Research: .claude/research/2026-01-01-go-scanner-architecture-patterns/github.md

**Verification:**
- All existing content preserved (moved to references/, not deleted)
- New content enhances without replacing existing guidance
- Chariot concurrency limits maintained
- All 6 original patterns intact
