## [Initial Creation] - 2026-01-14

### Added

- Initial skill creation: preventing-react-hook-infinite-loops
- Category: development/frontend (library skill)
- Type: Process/Pattern
- Core patterns:
  - Pattern 1: Serialized dependency keys
  - Pattern 2: Ref for mutable values
  - Pattern 3: Object comparison with JSON
  - Pattern 4: Stable callbacks from props
- Anti-pattern detection table
- Debugging workflow (5-step process)
- Chariot codebase examples (useClusterManagement, useViewportCulling)
- Integration section (Called By, Requires, Calls, Pairs With)
- Library integration patterns (React Query, Zustand, React Hook Form)

### RED Phase Documentation

**Gap**: React hooks compare dependencies by reference, not value. Without systematic patterns, developers create infinite loops when using objects/arrays in dependency arrays, causing browser freezes and "Maximum update depth exceeded" errors.

**Test Scenario**: Developer writes useEffect with array dependency that's recreated every render.

**Failure Without Skill**: Claude doesn't recognize reference instability, suggests object/array literals in deps, misses serialization/ref patterns.
