# Listing Skills

**Comprehensive listing of all skills across core and library locations.**

---

## What This Skill Does

Lists all skills with:

- ✅ Location (core vs library)
- ✅ Category (for library skills)
- ✅ Status (compliant vs has issues)
- ✅ Line count
- ✅ Description preview

---

## When to Use

- Getting overview of all available skills
- Understanding skill organization
- Planning new skill creation (avoid duplicates)
- Auditing skill coverage

**NOT for:**

- Searching for specific skills (use `searching-skills`)
- Auditing individual skills (use `auditing-skills`)

---

## Quick List

**List core skills:**

```bash
ls .claude/skills/
```

**List library skills:**

```bash
find .claude/skill-library -name "SKILL.md" -type f | \
  sed 's|.claude/skill-library/||' | \
  sed 's|/SKILL.md||' | \
  sort
```

---

## Step 1: Navigate to Repository Root (MANDATORY)

**Execute BEFORE any list operation:**

```bash
ROOT="$(git rev-parse --show-superproject-working-tree --show-toplevel | head -1)" && cd "$ROOT"
```

**⚠️ If skill file not found:** You are in the wrong directory. Navigate to repo root first. The file exists, you're just looking in the wrong place.

**Cannot proceed without navigating to repo root** ✅

---

## Workflow

### Step 2: List Core Skills

```bash
# Get all core skill directories
ls -d .claude/skills/*/

# For each, read SKILL.md frontmatter
Read .claude/skills/{skill-name}/SKILL.md | head -10
```

**Extract:**

- Skill name
- Description
- Line count (`wc -l`)

### Step 3: List Library Skills

```bash
# Get all library skills organized by category
find .claude/skill-library -name "SKILL.md" | sort
```

**Group by category:**

- Parse path to extract category
- Group skills under category headers

### Step 4: Check Status (Optional)

For each skill, check if it has issues:

```bash
# Quick validation
- Has frontmatter?
- Description valid?
- Under 500 lines?
```

Mark as:

- ✅ Compliant
- ⚠️ Has warnings
- ❌ Has errors

### Step 5: Format Output

```
