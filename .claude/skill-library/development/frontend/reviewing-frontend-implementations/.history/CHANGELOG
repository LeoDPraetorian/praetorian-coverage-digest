## [2026-01-15] Updated ESLint Verification

**Changed:**
- Replaced inline ESLint bash commands with reference to `using-eslint` skill in Step 4
- Added `using-eslint` to Related Skills section

**Rationale:**
- Inline bash was less robust (didn't check staged files, no --fix, no deduplication)
- `using-eslint` provides comprehensive ESLint execution with better git integration
- Eliminates duplication between review skill and standalone ESLint skill
- Ensures reviewers use same ESLint approach as developers

**Impact:**
- Line count: 142 lines → 155 lines (added explanation of skill benefits)
- Reviewers now invoke `using-eslint` skill instead of inline bash
- More consistent ESLint execution across workflows

## [2026-01-04] Initial Creation

**RED Phase Documentation:**
- **Gap**: frontend-reviewer agent was 235 lines, exceeding target of <150 lines
- **Problem**: Embedded Review Process (lines 116-216) contained ~100 lines of detailed methodology
- **Test Scenario**: Agent contained duplicate content preventing reuse and violating lean agent pattern
- **Failure**: frontend-reviewer.md was 235 lines with embedded process documentation

**GREEN Phase:**
- Extracted Review Process into library skill (142 lines)
- Follows pattern established by reviewing-backend-implementations
- 5-step review process: Locate Plan → Review Against Plan → Code Quality → Verification → Document

**Category**: frontend (library skill)
**Type**: Process/Pattern
**Location**: .claude/skill-library/frontend/reviewing-frontend-implementations/SKILL.md

**Agent Update** (Completed 2026-01-04):
- Removed embedded Review Process section (lines 116-216) from frontend-reviewer.md
- Reduced agent from 235 lines to 148 lines (87 line reduction)
- Added skill reference in semantic matching guidance
- Added "Review Workflow" section referencing the skill via gateway-frontend

**Gateway Update** (Completed 2026-01-04):
- Added routing to gateway-frontend Intent Detection table
- Created "Code Review" section in Skill Registry
- Triggers: "review", "code review", "PR review"

**REFACTOR Phase** (Completed 2026-01-04):
- Note: This is a reference/methodology skill, not a discipline-enforcement skill
- Pressure testing applies at agent level (frontend-reviewer), not skill level
- Skill verified for completeness and consistency with backend equivalent
- Tables formatted with prettier
- Frontmatter follows "Use when" pattern
- Line count: 142 lines (under 500 limit)
