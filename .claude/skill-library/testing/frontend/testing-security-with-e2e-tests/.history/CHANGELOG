# Changelog: testing-security-with-e2e-tests

## 2025-01-XX - Initial Creation

**Type:** Process/Pattern
**Category:** testing/frontend
**Location:** Skill Library

### RED Phase Documentation

**Gap Identified:**
Developers lack consolidated E2E security testing patterns for React frontends with Playwright. Without this skill, security tests are ad-hoc and miss critical scenarios like:
- XSS prevention testing with injection attempts
- Comprehensive authentication flow testing (session expiry, token refresh, MFA)
- Authorization boundary testing (RBAC, privilege escalation)
- CSRF protection validation
- Input validation with malicious payload fixtures
- Secure redirect handling
- Security regression testing in CI/CD

**Failure Behavior Without Skill:**
When asked to "Write comprehensive E2E security tests for React authentication", Claude would:
- Write basic login/logout tests only (no session expiry, token refresh, MFA)
- Not include authorization boundary tests (privilege escalation attempts)
- Not provide reusable security test fixtures for malicious payloads
- Not integrate OWASP security testing methodologies
- Not analyze existing Chariot E2E infrastructure for consistency
- Miss XSS injection test patterns
- Not test CSRF protection validation
- Not provide secure redirect handling patterns

**Search Verification:**
Confirmed no existing skills cover frontend E2E security testing with Playwright (search: "security e2e playwright frontend" returned 0 results).

### Skill Creation

**Structure:**
- SKILL.md: 265 lines (Process/Pattern template)
- Progressive disclosure with 7 reference files
- Examples directory for complete implementations

**Key Sections:**
1. Security Testing Fundamentals (OWASP integration)
2. XSS Prevention Testing
3. Authentication Flow Testing (with Page Object Model)
4. Authorization Testing (RBAC, privilege escalation)
5. CSRF Protection Testing
6. Input Validation Testing (malicious payload fixtures)
7. Secure Redirect Testing
8. Security Regression Testing (CI/CD integration)
9. Chariot E2E Infrastructure Integration

**Next Steps:**
- Phase 7: Research & populate reference files with researching-skills
- Phase 8: Update gateway-testing routing table
- Phase 9: GREEN verification (test skill with original scenario)
- Phase 10: REFACTOR pressure testing with subagents
