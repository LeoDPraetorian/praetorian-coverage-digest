# Attack Path Grouping Guide

**When and how to organize test cases into attack paths (ATK-X structure).**

---

## When to Use Attack Path Grouping

If test cases share a common attack objective or are part of an attack path:

### Identify Grouping Pattern

**Signals that indicate attack path grouping:**
- User request mentions "ATK-X" or attack path structure
- Multiple test cases target same vulnerability class
- Test cases build on each other (TC requires prior TC completion)
- Existing examples show attack path organization (e.g., ATK-1/)

## Attack Path Structure

### Directory Layout

**If grouping applies:**

```
ATK-X/
├── Execution Steps/              # Test instructions (generated by skill)
│   ├── README.md                 # Attack path overview
│   ├── TC-X.1-{title}.md
│   ├── TC-X.2-{title}.md
│   └── TC-X.N-{title}.md
└── Execution Results/            # Evidence storage (tester populates)
    └── .gitkeep                  # Empty placeholder
```

### Naming Conventions

- **Attack path directory:** `ATK-X` where X is attack path number
- **Test case IDs:** Follow attack path: `TC-X.1`, `TC-X.2`, etc.
- **README.md:** Describes full attack path objective, not just individual tests
- **Test case metadata:** Document attack path name

## Example: Session Hijacking Attack Path

**Attack Path:** `ATK-2: Session Token Extraction and Replay`

**Test cases:**
- TC-2.1: Session token storage analysis
- TC-2.2: Session token replay
- TC-2.3: ITP session anomaly detection
- TC-2.4: XSS session token extraction
- TC-2.5: Continuous session validation

**README structure:**
- Overview of attack path objective
- List of all test cases with time estimates
- Testing workflow (Day 1, Day 2, etc.)
- Prerequisites and tools
- Finding severity guidelines
- References

## Standalone Structure (No Attack Path)

**If no grouping:**

```
.claude/.output/{project-name}-testing/
├── README.md                     # Master overview
├── TC-{ID}-{title}.md            # Individual test cases
├── TC-{ID}-{title}.md
└── findings-template.md
```

**Standard naming:** `TC-{ID}-{kebab-case-title}.md`

---

## Decision Tree

```
Does user mention ATK-X structure?
├─ YES → Use attack path grouping
└─ NO
   └─ Do test cases build on each other?
      ├─ YES → Consider attack path grouping (ask user)
      └─ NO → Use standalone structure
```

---

## Creation Commands

```bash
# For attack paths
mkdir -p ATK-X/Execution\ Steps
mkdir -p ATK-X/Execution\ Results
touch ATK-X/Execution\ Results/.gitkeep

# Testers will populate results directory with:
# - TC-X.Y-results.md (finding documentation)
# - evidence/ (screenshots, logs, outputs)
# - findings/ (formatted vulnerability reports)
```

## Benefits of Attack Path Grouping

1. **Logical organization** - Related tests grouped together
2. **Progress tracking** - Clear attack path completion status
3. **Evidence management** - Centralized results directory
4. **Knowledge transfer** - Easier handoff between testers
5. **Reporting** - Attack path-based finding summaries
