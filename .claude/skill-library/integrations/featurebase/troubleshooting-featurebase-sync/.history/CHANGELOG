## 2026-01-14 - Initial Creation

**RED Phase Evidence:**
- Gap: No systematic workflow for debugging FeatureBase sync failures
- Test scenario: User says "The FeatureBase sync failed"
- Current failure: Generic suggestions, no structured approach, long debugging time
- Expected with skill: Systematic diagnosis with failure-mode-specific fixes

**Category:** integrations/featurebase

**Skill Type:** Process/Pattern (debugging workflow)

**Initial Features:**
- Phase 1: Identify failure mode (GitHub Actions, MCP tool, validation)
- Phase 2A: GitHub Actions workflow debugging (6 failure modes)
- Phase 2B: MCP tool failures (status code specific fixes)
- Phase 2C: YAML validation failures (syntax errors)
- Phase 3: Verify fix and document root cause
- Decision tree for failure mode identification
- Common failure mode catalog
- Integration with syncing-featurebase-content skill

**Dependencies:**
- GitHub CLI (gh) for workflow log access
- validate-frontmatter.ts script
- syncing-featurebase-content skill for re-running sync
