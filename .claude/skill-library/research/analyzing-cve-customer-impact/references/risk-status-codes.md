| **OM** | Open Medium | Medium severity, not yet triaged | Review and address |
| **OL** | Open Low | Low severity, not yet triaged | Review and address |
| **TC** | Triaged Confirmed | Confirmed valid, being addressed | In progress |
| **TI** | Triaged Informational | Informational only, no action needed | Acknowledge |
| **TF** | Triaged False Positive | Not a real vulnerability | Closed |
| **AH** | Addressed High | High severity, remediated | Verified fixed |
| **AM** | Addressed Medium | Medium severity, remediated | Verified fixed |
| **AL** | Addressed Low | Low severity, remediated | Verified fixed |

## Status Categories

### Open Risks (O*)
- Not yet triaged or addressed
- Requires customer attention
- **Count as VULNERABLE** in exposure metrics

### Triaged Risks (T*)
- Under investigation or remediation
- Customer is aware and working on it
- **Count as VULNERABLE** but "in progress"

### Addressed Risks (A*)
- Remediated and verified
- **Do NOT count as VULNERABLE** in current exposure

## Usage in Impact Reports

**Categorize assets by status:**

```markdown
**Risk Status Breakdown:**
- **Open:** 2 assets (OH, OM) - Immediate action required
- **Triaged:** 1 asset (TC) - Remediation in progress
- **Addressed:** 1 asset (AH) - Already fixed
```

**Impact calculation:**
- Open + Triaged = Currently vulnerable (3 assets)
- Addressed = Previously vulnerable, now safe (1 asset)

**Priority adjustment:**
- All Open (OH/OM/OL) = Highest priority (untouched)
- Triaged (TC/TI/TF) = Medium priority (being handled)
- Addressed (AH/AM/AL) = Low priority (verification only)
