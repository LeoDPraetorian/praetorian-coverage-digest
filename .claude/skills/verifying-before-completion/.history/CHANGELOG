## [2026-01-10] - Exit Criteria Interpretation

### Added
- New "Exit Criteria Interpretation (LITERAL RULE)" section after Common Failures table
- Table mapping exit criteria statements to literal unit counts vs incorrect interpretations
- Real-world ambiguity trap example (118 files vs 118 function calls)
- 5-step verification protocol for exit criteria
- Guidance for handling ambiguous exit criteria wording

### Context
Addresses documented failure where agent claimed "118 navigation calls updated" when exit criteria required "118 files updated" - only 47 files were actually modified. New section enforces literal interpretation of completion metrics to prevent favorable but incorrect counting.
