## [Date: 2024-12-19] - Initial Creation

### Created
- Skill created via creating-skills workflow
- RED failure documented: Threat modeling Phase 3 lacks standardized CVSS scoring with business context integration
- Category: security (skill-library)
- Type: Process/Pattern (CVSS scoring methodology)
- Target: Standalone open-source threat modeling tool
- Key features:
  - CVSS version selection (3.1 recommended, 4.0 optional)
  - Base metric assessment for theoretical threats
  - Temporal/Threat metrics with conservative defaults
  - Environmental metrics auto-derived from Phase 0 business context
  - Structured JSON output for threat-model.json

## [Date: 2024-12-19] - Content Population Complete

### Added
- Reference files (5):
  - version-comparison.md (287 lines) - CVSS 3.1 vs 4.0 detailed analysis
  - base-metrics-guide.md (534 lines) - Complete Base metric assessment guidance
  - temporal-threat-metrics.md (437 lines) - Temporal/Threat metrics with defaults
  - environmental-metrics.md (725 lines) - Phase 0 integration formulas
  - calculation-formulas.md (785 lines) - Complete CVSS 3.1 mathematics

- Example files (3):
  - sql-injection-scoring.md (531 lines) - Payment API SQLi walkthrough
  - authentication-bypass.md (137 lines) - JWT bypass walkthrough
  - privilege-escalation.md (140 lines) - User→Admin walkthrough

### Modified
- SKILL.md - Added TodoWrite mandate (Phase 13 fix)
- gateway-security - Added cvss-scoring to Phase 3 section

### Audit
- Status: PASSED (0 critical, 0 warnings, 2 info)
- All 16 phases validated
- Progressive disclosure: SKILL.md 324 lines, references total ~2,800 lines

## [Date: 2024-12-19] - TDD Complete (Phases 8-9)

### Phase 8: GREEN - Skill Verification
- Original RED scenario re-tested with skill loaded
- Gap successfully closed: Provides standardized CVSS with Phase 0 integration
- Analyst can now score threats consistently with business context
- Audit status: PASSED (0 critical, 0 warnings, 2 info)

### Phase 9: REFACTOR - Pressure Testing
- Test 1 (Time + Emergency): PASSED - Agent used Environmental despite deadline
- Test 2 (Authority + Expertise): PASSED - Agent advocated for Environmental despite senior pushback
- Test 3 (Pragmatic + Efficiency): PASSED - Agent continued Environmental despite volume pressure

**Result: Skill is bulletproof on first iteration - no hardening required**

All agents:
- Read and followed "Environmental Metrics Are Mandatory" rule
- Explicitly rejected rationalization pressures
- Cited skill's "Not even when" section
- Delivered complete Environmental scoring

### Status
- TDD cycle: COMPLETE (RED → GREEN → REFACTOR)
- Production ready: YES
- Gateway integration: gateway-security updated
- Next step: Use in threat modeling Phase 3 workflows

## [Date: 2024-12-20] - Default to CVSS 4.0

### Changed
- **Quick Reference table**: Swapped rows to list CVSS 4.0 as "(Recommended)" (line 30), CVSS 3.1 as "Legacy compatibility" (line 31)
- **Step 1 AskUserQuestion**: Reordered options so CVSS 4.0 is first (Recommended), 3.1 is second (lines 52-66)
- **Default recommendation**: Changed from "CVSS 3.1 unless user has specific need for 4.0" to "CVSS 4.0 unless legacy system compatibility requires 3.1" (line 71)
- **Typical Workflow**: Updated default from "3.1" to "4.0" (line 35)
- **Version Selection Default**: Changed from "Always default to CVSS 3.1" to "Always default to CVSS 4.0" with updated exception list (lines 268-273)

### Reason
- RED failure: Skill recommended CVSS 3.1 as default, but CVSS 4.0 is the current industry standard (released 2023)
- Agents following this skill would produce threat models with outdated CVSS 3.1 scoring instead of industry-standard 4.0
- CVSS 4.0 provides better score differentiation, Supplemental metrics, and future-proof security tooling compatibility
- 3.1 preserved as option for organizations with NVD/legacy tool requirements

### Impact
- Line count: 326 → 328 lines (+2 lines, well under 500 limit)
- Skill now defaults to current industry standard (CVSS 4.0)
- AskUserQuestion options reordered to prioritize 4.0
- 3.1 remains available for legacy compatibility
- Aligns with threat-modeling-orchestrator skill's CVSS 4.0 integration (2024-12-19/20)
