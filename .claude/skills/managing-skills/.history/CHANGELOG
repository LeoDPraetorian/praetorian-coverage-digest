## [Date: 2025-12-30] - Add Phase Numbering Convention Note

### Changed
- `references/patterns/changelog-format.md` - Clarified Phase 5.4 reference and added phase numbering convention note
- Updated line 10: Changed "Phase 5.4" to "Phase 5, sub-step 5.4" to clarify it's a sub-step, not fractional major phase
- Added Phase Numbering Convention section at top of document

### Added
- **Phase Numbering Convention** section explaining:
  - Major phases use sequential integers (1, 2, 3, 4, 5...)
  - Fractional phase numbers like "Phase 3.5" are not used
  - When adding phases, renumber sequentially
  - Sub-steps within phases (5.1, 5.2, 5.4) are acceptable for decomposition

### Reason
- **RED failure**: Reference to "Phase 5.4" was ambiguous - could be interpreted as fractional major phase
- Completes 4-skill update sequence for phase numbering hygiene
- Recent updates established phase numbering hygiene standards:
  - `updating-skills` - Added Phase Numbering Rule (prevention)
  - `auditing-skills` - Added Semantic Criterion 7 (detection)
  - `fixing-skills` - Added fix guidance (remediation)
- Need to clarify that creating-skills uses acceptable sub-steps (5.1, 5.2, 5.4), not fractional major phases
- Document should include the phase numbering convention for reference

### Technical Details
- Phase 5.4 in creating-skills is **correct** per phase numbering hygiene:
  - Major phase: `## Phase 5: Generate Skill Structure`
  - Sub-step: `### 5.4 Create Initial Changelog`
  - This is decomposition (acceptable), not insertion (problematic)
- Updated reference to clarify structure: "Phase 5, sub-step 5.4"
- Added convention note to prevent confusion about acceptable vs problematic numbering

### Files Changed
- `references/patterns/changelog-format.md` - Added convention note, clarified Phase 5.4 reference

### Impact
- Completes 4-skill update sequence for phase numbering hygiene
- Provides clear documentation of numbering conventions
- Prevents misinterpretation of sub-steps as fractional major phases
- Single source of truth for changelog format now includes numbering guidance

### Related Updates
- Part of 4-skill update sequence:
  1. ✅ `updating-skills` - Added Phase Numbering Rule (prevention)
  2. ✅ `auditing-skills` - Added detection criterion (Semantic Criterion 7)
  3. ✅ `fixing-skills` - Added fix guidance (remediation)
  4. ✅ `managing-skills` - Added convention note (this update - documentation)

## [Date: 2025-12-27] - Add centralized table-formatting reference

### Added
- New reference file `references/table-formatting.md` - Centralized single source of truth for markdown table formatting
- Link to table-formatting.md in "Deep Dives (references/)" section of SKILL.md

### Reason
- **RED failure**: No centralized documentation for table formatting requirements
- Four skills (creating-skills, updating-skills, auditing-skills, fixing-skills) would need to duplicate table formatting guidance
- No single source of truth for Prettier-based validation standards
- Risk of inconsistent table formatting across skills without centralized requirements

### Technical Details
- Cross-cutting concern: Applies to creating, updating, auditing, and fixing skills
- Documents Phase 14g (sub-phase of Reference Validation) for auditing-skills
- Documents Tier 1 (Deterministic) fix approach for fixing-skills
- Includes Prettier CLI commands for validation and auto-fix
- Contains examples of correct vs incorrect table formatting

### Files Changed
- `SKILL.md` - Added link to table-formatting.md in Deep Dives section (line 189)
- `references/table-formatting.md` - New file (~280 lines) with comprehensive table formatting documentation

### Method
- Used `updating-skills` workflow with TDD
- Backup created: `.local/2024-12-27-managing-skills.bak`
- Line count: 237 → 238 lines (safe zone)

### REFACTOR Assessment
- **Change Classification**: Documentation update (adds reference, no behavioral change)
