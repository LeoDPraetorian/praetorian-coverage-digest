## 2026-01-02 - Initial Creation

### RED Phase Evidence
- **Gap**: During go-cicd Phase 2 implementation, agents wrote tests that achieved 94.8% coverage but ~40% were low-value (constant identity tests, trivial getters, length-only assertions)
- **Failure**: Agent instructed to "add tests for 90% coverage" produced coverage-padding tests like `TestNodeType_Values` that only verify constants equal themselves
- **Impact**: Coverage numbers looked good but tests wouldn't catch real bugs; concurrency tests missing despite mutex usage

### Implementation
- **Location**: skill-library/testing/
- **Type**: Process/Pattern (methodology)
- **Content**:
  - 5 low-value patterns to avoid with examples
  - 5 high-value patterns required with examples
  - Mandatory checklist (7 categories)
  - Anti-pattern detection table
  - Counter-arguments for common rationalizations
