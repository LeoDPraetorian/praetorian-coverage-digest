### **I.1 PAL Truth Tables** {#app09.xhtml_app09_1 .h3}

Programmable array logic (PAL) and generic array logic (GAL) devices
were early technologies for programmable logic that predate CPLD and
FPGA devices. Programming methods were often unique to the brand of the
chip, while the pinout and functionality were compatible between
vendors. These days, they are mostly dumped for retrocomputing emulation
and repair projects.

DuPAL is an open suite of tools for PAL reverse engineering, available
as Battaglia (2020). It consists of a hardware board with an Atmega chip
for applying inputs and sampling outputs of a PAL chip, and GUI tools in
Java that can export observations or test potential chip configurations.

DuPAL does not read the raw memory out of the chip, so it is limited to
states that can be externally observed from inputs and outputs. This
gets confusing when output values are fed back as inputs, sometimes with
a delay for synchronous logic.

Surply (2015) describes the use of an Arduino Uno to dump the truth
table of a PAL16L8 chip from a pinball machine. The truth tables were
too large to reduce with Karnaugh mapping, but Surply was able to use
the Quine-McCluskey method in the form of Niels Serup's Electruth
library for Python to minimize the PAL's truth table in a few hours,
revealing the address space of the machine's many I/O ports.

> **Description:** Die photograph of small smart card chip or secure element. Center region dominated by large memory array with regular cell structure. Peripheral circuits include analog front-end (left edge), clock/power management, and I/O interfaces (right side). Bond pads arranged around perimeter with twelve mounting holes visible as black circles. Compact design typical of ISO 7816 contact smart card or NFC secure element. Limited die area suggests focused security functions like cryptographic coprocessor, secure storage, and authentication. Vulnerable to physical attacks including invasive probing, laser fault injection, or electromagnetic analysis targeting memory and crypto blocks.

[]{#app09.xhtml_page_407 .pagebreak}It's also possible to dump these
chips visually. PALs mark truth table bits with electromigration fuses.
These work by running too much current through a very thin metal trace,
causing the metal to flow along the path of the current, which breaks
the trace.

### **I.2 Mifare Classic Gate Recovery** {#app09.xhtml_app09_2 .h3}

Nohl et al. (2008) describes a successful reverse engineering of a
then-secret cryptographic algorithm used by NXP's Mifare Classic RFID
tags. The chip, shown in [Figure I.2](#app09.xhtml_chIfig2), is barely a
millimeter square, available in 1K and 4K versions.

Nohl required both surface and delayered photographs for this recovery,
then used edge detection and pattern matching to recognize the
standard-cell library of the chip. Though there are many thousands of
gates on the chip, there are only seventy or so unique logic cells. The
gate tileset has been published as SRL (2012b).

Of the six chip layers, the upper ones obscured cell identification.
These were removed by mechanical polishing rather than through chemical
etching. Images were then stitched with Hugin, and as Degate had not yet
been written, custom Matlab scripts were used to perform standard cell
identification.

After the Mifare Classic was reverse engineered, Plötz and Nohl (2011)
followed with details of reverse engineering the Legic Prime RFID tag.
The authors dumped their custom Matlab scripts for Degate, and published
their tile set as SRL (2012a).

> **Description:** Die photograph showing secure chip with prominent markings. Left side features large memory block with "F8C01" designation clearly visible in metal layers. Center and right sections contain mixed logic blocks, smaller memory arrays, and peripheral circuits. "F8C01+A" label appears in central-right region. Top edge displays horizontal memory structures. Multiple dark squares scattered throughout are decoupling capacitors or power management circuits. The visible part numbers suggest specific chip variant or revision useful for identifying vulnerability databases, datasheet references, or known attack techniques applicable to this particular device version.
