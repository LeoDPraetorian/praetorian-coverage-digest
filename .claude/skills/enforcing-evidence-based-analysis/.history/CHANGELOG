# Changelog - enforcing-evidence-based-analysis

## 2026-01-19 - Integration Section Added (Phase 28)

**Context:** Audit revealed missing Integration section (Phase 28 WARNING). Applied Claude-Automated fix.

**Fixes Applied:**

1. **Phase 28: Integration Section (Claude-Automated)**
   - Added complete Integration section with Called-By, Requires, Calls, Pairs-With subsections
   - Called By: `orchestrating-integration-development`, `preferring-simple-solutions`
   - Requires: None (foundational workflow skill)
   - Calls: None (provides protocol, doesn't invoke other skills)
   - Pairs With: `verifying-before-completion`, `writing-plans`, `developing-with-tdd`, `debugging-systematically`
   - Inserted before existing "Related Skills" section

**Audit Results:**
- Before: 1 WARNING (Phase 28)
- After: 0 WARNINGS (all phases pass)

**Method:** Phase 28 fix procedure (analyze content → search references → generate Integration → insert)

**Line Count:** 115 → 142 lines (still well under 500 line limit)

## 2025-12-28 - Compliance Fixes (Audit-Driven)

**Context:** Full audit revealed 3 CRITICAL and 3 INFO issues. Applied complete fix workflow.

**Fixes Applied:**

1. **Phase 7: Output Directory (CLI - Deterministic)**
   - Added `.local/` directory for runtime artifacts

2. **Phase 13: State Externalization (Claude-Automated)**
   - Added TodoWrite mandate at skill introduction
   - Directive: "You MUST use TodoWrite before starting analysis or planning tasks to track which files you've verified and which claims need evidence"

3. **Phase 3: Word Count (Claude-Automated)**
   - Extracted "Evidence-Based Protocol" to `references/protocol.md`
   - Extracted "Why This Matters" (wizard failure case study) to `references/why-this-matters.md`
   - Condensed "Common Rationalizations" table to bullet summary
   - Removed "Progressive Disclosure" section (redundant with references)
   - Result: 906 words → 573 words (under 600-word limit)

4. **Gateway Membership (Claude-Automated - Semantic)**
   - Added skill to `gateway-claude` under new "Core Workflow Skills" section
   - Grouped with: `verifying-before-completion`, `developing-with-tdd`, `debugging-systematically`
   - Rationale: Frequently invoked during planning/development workflows

**Audit Results:**
- Before: 2 CRITICAL, 3 INFO
- After: 0 CRITICAL, 1 WARNING (word count target suggestion)

**Method:** Full fixing workflow (deterministic → Claude-automated → semantic)
