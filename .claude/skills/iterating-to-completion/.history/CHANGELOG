# Changelog

## 2026-01-14 - Initial Creation

### RED Phase Documentation

**Gap identified**: No skill exists for same-agent iteration loops with safety guards. Current state:
- Orchestration skills manually implement retry logic
- No scratchpad for cross-iteration context
- No loop detection (infinite loops possible)
- No standardized safety guards
- No completion promise pattern

**Test scenario**: Orchestration skill needs to run tests in a loop until passing. Without this skill, orchestrator must manually track iterations, errors, and detect loops.

### Skill Details

- **Location**: Core (.claude/skills/)
- **Type**: Process/Pattern
- **Category**: Agentic workflow control

### Source

Based on:
- [Ralph Wiggum technique](https://awesomeclaude.ai/ralph-wiggum) by Geoffrey Huntley
- [ralph-orchestrator](https://github.com/mikeyobrien/ralph-orchestrator) by Mike O'Brien

Key patterns adapted:
- Completion promise (explicit string signals task complete)
- Agent scratchpad (cross-iteration context)
- Safety guards (max_iterations, max_runtime, consecutive_errors)
- Loop detection (signature extraction, 3-consecutive threshold)
- Error history injection

### Files Created

### Integration Points

Called by:
- `orchestrating-capability-development` (Phase 6: Testing)
- `orchestrating-fingerprintx-development` (Phase 2: Research, Phase 5: Validation)
- `orchestrating-feature-development` (Phase 5: Implementation - complex batches)

Pairs with:
- `persisting-agent-outputs` - Get feature_directory for scratchpad
- `debugging-systematically` - When loop is stuck
- `verifying-before-completion` - Before claiming completion promise valid
