## [Date: 2024-12-17] - Initial Creation

### Created
- Skill created via creating-skills workflow
- RED failure documented: Without orchestrator, threat modeling achieves ~5% completeness (ad-hoc, no structure, no phases, no state)
- Location: Core skill (.claude/skills/)
- Type: Process/Pattern

### Key Features
- Multi-phase workflow (4 phases)
- Parallel agent execution for large codebases
- Human checkpoints between all phases
- State persistence in .claude/.threat-model/{session}/
- Structured outputs (MD + JSON + SARIF)

### Dependencies
- codebase-mapping skill (Phase 1 methodology) - EXISTS
- codebase-mapper agent (Phase 1 executor) - EXISTS
- security-controls-mapping skill (Phase 2) - PENDING
- security-controls-mapper agent (Phase 2) - PENDING
- threat-modeling skill (Phase 3) - PENDING
- security-test-planning skill (Phase 4) - PENDING
