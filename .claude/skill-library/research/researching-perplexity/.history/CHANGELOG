## 2025-12-31 - Initial Creation

**Type**: New skill creation

**RED Phase Documentation**:
- **Gap Identified**: researching-skills router only supports 5 sources (Codebase, Context7, GitHub, arxiv, Web). No skill exists to orchestrate Perplexity MCP for AI-powered research as a 6th option.
- **Failure Scenario**: User wants to select "Perplexity" from researching-skills menu → option doesn't exist. User tries to use Perplexity manually → output format incompatible with synthesis requirements.
- **Need**: Skill to orchestrate Perplexity research (API validation, query formulation, tool selection, execution, output formatting) with output compatible with researching-skills synthesis (perplexity.md file format).

**Category**: Library skill - `research/`

**Skill Type**: Tool Wrapper (wraps Perplexity MCP CLI and underlying wrappers)

**Integration**:
- Sibling to researching-web in `.claude/skill-library/research/`
- Called by researching-skills router when Perplexity source selected
- Output saved to `perplexity.md` in research directory

**Structure Created**:
- SKILL.md (273 lines - well under 500 line limit)
- references/tool-selection.md - Decision matrix for search vs ask vs research vs reason
- references/output-format.md - Output template matching researching-web format
- references/query-templates.md - Search query patterns by intent type

**Key Features**:
- 5-phase workflow: API Validation → Query Formulation → Tool Selection → Execution → Output Formatting
- API key detection with setup instructions if missing
- 4 Perplexity commands (search, ask, research, reason) with selection logic
- Citation tracking and AI synthesis notes
- Compatible with researching-skills synthesis format

**Tools**: Bash, Read, Write, TodoWrite

**Next Steps**:
- GREEN phase: Test with researching-skills router
- REFACTOR phase: Pressure test with subagents
- Update researching-skills router to add Perplexity as 6th source
