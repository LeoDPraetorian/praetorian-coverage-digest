# Q3FY25 Roadmap

[ Back to Overview](../OVERVIEW.md)

**Theme: Core AI Orchestrator Infrastructure**

This quarter marks a pivotal transformation for Chariot, moving it from a collection of powerful tools into a cohesive, AI-driven platform. Our focus is on delivering foundational stability for our internal teams, building the core operator-driven automation engine, and launching the first intelligent agent capable of dynamic decision-making.

## Major Milestone

**Core AI Orchestrator Infrastructure**: Deliver foundational stability and tooling for full Professional Services (PS) onboarding while launching the first wave of intelligent agents. The primary focus is creating a Planner Agent MVP that can orchestrate new, specialized sub-agents for high-impact risks.

By proving the end-to-end agentic loop (goal execution result) while concurrently finalizing the PlexTrac integration, Burp plugin, and engagement management UIs, we establish the core AI engine and enable the PS team to leverage Chariot for all engagements.

## Agentification Partial

**Epic**: [CHA-2695](https://praetorianlabs.atlassian.net/browse/CHA-2695)

Launch the Prometheus Agent Orchestration Service, giving life to the first intelligent agent. Operators interact through dedicated GUI and CLI, guiding its "Dual-Tool Logic" as it dynamically chooses between high-level workflows and specific capabilities.

**Implementation Status**: Basic ReAct agent exists using AWS Bedrock + Claude (not Google ADK). Single agent with tool use and conversation state, but NOT hierarchical multi-agent orchestration. Sub-agents (SQLi, XSS, Zero-Day specialists) not implemented.

### The Dawn of Prometheus

Built with safety as a non-negotiable principle:

- Scope validation
- Task constraints
- Workflow cancellation
- Customer data privacy controls

### Requirements

## Operator & Agent Workflow Engine Not Started

**Epic**: [CHA-2780](https://praetorianlabs.atlassian.net/browse/CHA-2780)

Build the core of the Chariot Workflow Engine, delivering backend services and APIs for creating, managing, and executing deterministic, multi-step attack chains.

**Implementation Status**: Workflow Engine is NOT implemented. Job/Task models exist in Tabularium, async Lambda execution works, and Janus framework handles tool chaining, but formal workflow orchestration does not exist. No Temporal.io integration, no React Flow UI builder, no conditional/looping constructs.

### Workflow Transform Engine

The backend Workflow Transform Engine automatically maps data between steps, allowing any two capabilities to be chained together seamlessly for true operational composability.

### DEMO-004: The Improvising Agent (Flagship Demo)

The single most important demo of the quarter, validating the core architectural principle of Dual-Tool Logic:

1. **Set a Broad Goal**: Operator gives high-level goal via GUI
2. **Execute Known Workflow**: Agent runs pre-built "Web Recon & Discovery" workflow
3. **Identify Gap & Improvise**: Agent finds no SQLi workflow, searches low-level capabilities
4. **Execute Low-Level Capability**: Agent dynamically calls Run-SQLmap-Scan
5. **Confirm Goal Completion**: Vulnerability confirmed through intelligent combination

This demonstrates the first time the agent improvises, moving beyond pre-defined scripts and showcasing flexible reasoning central to the Chariot vision.
