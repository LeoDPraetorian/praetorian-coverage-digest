  - 3 classification categories: FALSE POSITIVE, TRUE POSITIVE, KMS ENCRYPTED
  - 5 detailed classification examples with real-world patterns
  - Quick decision tree for rapid classification
  - Report format grouped by classification (not by function)
  - Integration with Phase 4 verification workflow

### Changed
