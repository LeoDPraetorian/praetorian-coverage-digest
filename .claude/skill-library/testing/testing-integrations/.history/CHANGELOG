# Changelog - testing-integrations

## [2026-01-12] Initial Creation

**RED Phase Documentation:**

**Problem**: Developers writing tests for Chariot backend integrations lack guidance on:
- Mock HTTP server patterns (httptest)
- Mock Chariot collector usage (mock.Collector)
- Required test cases for P0 compliance (VMFilter, CheckAffiliation, ValidateCredentials, errgroup, pagination)
- Table-driven test patterns for Go integration tests
- Rate limit and retry logic testing
- Concurrency testing patterns

**Failure without skill**: Integration tests miss critical P0 requirement coverage, use incorrect mocking patterns, fail to test error conditions (429, 5xx, timeouts), have race conditions in concurrent tests, and lack proper pagination testing.

**Category**: Library skill (testing)
**Skill Type**: Process/Pattern (testing methodology)
**Location**: .claude/skill-library/testing/testing-integrations/

**Structure Created**:
- SKILL.md (328 lines - progressive disclosure)
- references/ directory (to be populated with research)
- examples/ directory
- .history/CHANGELOG (this file)

**Next Steps**:
- Phase 6: Research and populate reference files
- Phase 7: Update gateway-testing and/or gateway-backend routing tables
- Phase 8: GREEN phase verification
- Phase 9: REFACTOR phase pressure testing
