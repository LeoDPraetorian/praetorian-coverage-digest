## 2026-01-04 - Output Path Migration

**Change Type:** Path Update

**What Changed:**
- Updated all references from `.claude/features/` to `.claude/.output/testing/`
- Added timestamp format documentation: `date +"%Y-%m-%d-%H%M%S"`
- Aligned with new output structure convention used by orchestrating-research

**Files Modified:**
- SKILL.md:78 - Agent output path verification
- SKILL.md:121 - Directory check in verification steps
- SKILL.md:122 - Added timestamp format documentation with example
- SKILL.md:133 - JSON metadata feature_directory field

**Reason:**
The `.claude/features/` directory was removed from the repository. Test outputs now go to `.claude/.output/testing/` subdirectory to maintain consistency across the skill system and follow the pattern established by other output-generating skills like orchestrating-research.

**Impact:**
Agents using pressure-testing-skill-content will now write test outputs to the correct location that exists in the repository structure.
