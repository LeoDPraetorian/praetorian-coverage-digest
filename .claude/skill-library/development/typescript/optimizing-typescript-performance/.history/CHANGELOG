## 2026-01-02 - Initial Creation

**RED Phase Documentation:**

Large TypeScript codebases suffer from severe compilation performance issues:
- Build times of 5-10+ minutes block CI/CD pipelines
- Type instantiation depth errors halt development
- Complex generated types can 10x+ compilation time
- IDE performance degradation makes development painful

Current failure behavior without this skill:
- Developers search for generic advice without diagnostic methodology
- Trial-and-error optimization without measurement
- No systematic approach to type instantiation depth errors
- Lack of monorepo-specific optimization patterns (project references)

**Category:** development/typescript (library)
**Skill Type:** Process/Pattern (methodology and workflow)

**Content Extracted From:** `.claude/skill-library/development/typescript/typescript-advanced/SKILL.md` lines 693-699 (deleted skill)
- Avoid deeply nested conditional types
- Use simple types when possible
- Cache complex type computations
- Limit recursion depth in recursive types
- Skip type checking in production builds

**Expanded With:**
- Diagnostic tools (`--diagnostics`, `--extendedDiagnostics`, `--generateTrace`)
- Type instantiation depth error patterns and solutions
- Project references for monorepo optimization
- TypeScript 5.x performance characteristics
- Systematic measurement methodology (BEFORE/AFTER metrics)

**Structure:** 494 lines (within <500 limit)

**Target Use Cases:**
- Build times >1 minute
- Type instantiation depth errors
- Out of memory errors during compilation
- IDE performance degradation
- Large monorepo with multiple TypeScript projects (Chariot: 16 submodules)
- Generated code with large type files (Tabularium)
