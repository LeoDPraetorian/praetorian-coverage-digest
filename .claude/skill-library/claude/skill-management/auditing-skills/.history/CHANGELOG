# Changelog - auditing-skills

## [Unreleased]

### Changed
- Reference file line limit increased from 400 to 500 lines
- Phase 3b criticality now percentage-based instead of absolute
- Line overages >500 now WARNING (not CRITICAL) unless significantly oversized (>600 lines = 20% over)
- Updated detection command from `> 400` to `> 500` with WARNING severity
- Updated phase-details.md token economics: 200-500 lines (~400-1,000 tokens)

### Rationale
Line overages are normal during development. Making overages CRITICAL was too aggressive and blocked legitimate work. Percentage-based criticality allows flexibility while still encouraging splitting when files become too large (>500 lines).

## 2026-01-19 - Phase Criticality Recalibration

**Changed:**
- Updated phase criticality counts: CRITICAL reduced from 10 to 9 phases (removed Phase 27)
- Updated minimum viable audit from 18 to 17 phases (9 CRITICAL + 8 HIGH)
- Updated total applicable phases from 30 to 29
- Removed Phase 27 (Relative Path Depth) from CRITICAL table - reclassified as lower priority

**Rationale:**
Phase 27 (Relative Path Depth) check for `../../` vs `.claude/` paths is important for maintainability but doesn't block skill loading or cause errors. Moved out of CRITICAL tier to allow faster minimum viable audits while still catching blocking structural issues.

**Impact:**
- Minimum viable audit now 17 phases instead of 18 (5% faster)
- Full comprehensive audit still covers all necessary phases
- No reduction in audit quality - just better prioritization
