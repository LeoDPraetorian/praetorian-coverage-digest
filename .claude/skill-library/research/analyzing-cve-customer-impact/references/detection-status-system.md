# Detection Status System

**Progressive detection status that evolves through threat intel → customer impact → remediation phases.**

## Status Definitions (Phase 2 Refined)

| Status | Color | Symbol | Meaning | When Applied |
|--------|-------|--------|---------|--------------|
| **COVERED** | 🟢 Green | ✅ | Template exists, customer not exposed | Phase 1 COVERED + No customer assets |
| **COVERED-EXPOSED** | 🟡 Yellow | ⚠️ | Template exists, customer IS exposed | Phase 1 COVERED + Customer has vulnerable assets |
| **GAP** (critical) | 🔴 Red | ❌ | No template, customer exposed | Phase 1 GAP + Customer has vulnerable assets |
| **GAP** (lower priority) | 🔴 Red | ❌ | No template, customer safe | Phase 1 GAP + No customer assets |

**Note:** Phase 3 further refines GAP statuses to IN DEVELOPMENT when remediation is triggered.

## Customer Exposure Impact on Priority

| Status | Assets Affected | Priority Level | Urgency |
|--------|----------------|---------------|---------|
| **COVERED-EXPOSED** | Yes | P1 (MEDIUM) | Patch required, detection active |
| **COVERED** | No | P3 (LOW) | Monitoring only |
| **GAP** | Yes | P0 (CRITICAL) | Immediate: Patch + create template |
| **GAP** | No | P2 (HIGH) | Create template for ecosystem protection |

## Report Format

**Include customer-specific status in IMPACT.md:**
