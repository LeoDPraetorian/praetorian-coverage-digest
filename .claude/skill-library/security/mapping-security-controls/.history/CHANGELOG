## [2026-01-04] - Initial Creation

### Context
- **Gap**: security-controls-mapper agent exceeded 274 lines (target <200, max 200)
- **RED test**: Agent contains 122 lines of embedded methodology (lines 98-220)
- **Category**: Library skill (security)
- **Type**: Process/methodology

### Content Extracted
- Operating Modes (mode detection, triggers, outputs)
- Per-Concern Investigation (5-step workflow)
- Full Mapping Methodology (10 control categories with descriptions)
- Gap Analysis Levels (severity classification)
- STRIDE Alignment (control-to-threat mapping)
- Output Schemas (per-concern and full mapping directory structures)

### Purpose
- Reduce agent line count to ~150 lines
- Make methodology reusable across multiple agents
- Enable consistent control mapping workflows
- Support threat modeling Phase 4 orchestration
