# Changelog

All notable changes to this skill will be documented in this file.

## [2026-01-18] - Integration Section

### Added
- New "Integration" section documenting skill relationships
- "Called By" subsection listing 4 orchestration workflows, 1 development workflow, and 13 agent types
- "Requires" subsection documenting no prerequisites (standalone skill)
- "Calls" subsection documenting no delegations (terminal verification skill)
- "Pairs With" subsection documenting no conditional pairing (mandatory gate)

### Context
Phase 28 compliance fix from audit. Integration section makes explicit that this skill is invoked as a mandatory completion gate by all orchestration workflows and agent types before completion claims. Clarifies the skill's role as a terminal verification gate with no prerequisites or delegations.

### Method
Claude-Automated fix via auditing-skills + fixing-skills workflow. Analyzed 236 references across codebase to identify all callers.

## [2026-01-10] - Exit Criteria Interpretation

### Added
- New "Exit Criteria Interpretation (LITERAL RULE)" section after Common Failures table
- Table mapping exit criteria statements to literal unit counts vs incorrect interpretations
- Real-world ambiguity trap example (118 files vs 118 function calls)
- 5-step verification protocol for exit criteria
- Guidance for handling ambiguous exit criteria wording

### Context
Addresses documented failure where agent claimed "118 navigation calls updated" when exit criteria required "118 files updated" - only 47 files were actually modified. New section enforces literal interpretation of completion metrics to prevent favorable but incorrect counting.
