## 2025-12-30 - Initial Creation

**Type**: New skill creation

**RED Phase Documentation**:
- **Gap Identified**: The researching-skills router is being refactored into specialized research skills (researching-protocols, researching-context7, researching-codebase, researching-arxiv). No fallback skill exists for general web research when these specialized skills don't apply.
- **Failure Scenario**: Without this skill, agents would either try to use Context7 for non-indexed APIs (fails), use researching-codebase for external resources (wrong tool), or do ad-hoc web searches without methodology (inconsistent quality).
- **Need**: Research skill for API documentation not in Context7, blog posts, tutorials, GitHub resources, Stack Overflow, official documentation, general technical research, and comparing multiple approaches/libraries.

**Category**: Library skill - `claude/skill-management/`

**Skill Type**: Process/Pattern (research methodology)

**Integration**:
- Future router parent: researching-skills (planned refactor to router pattern)
- Sibling skills: researching-protocols, researching-context7, researching-codebase, researching-arxiv
- Fallback role: Use when other specialized research skills don't apply

**Structure Created**:
- SKILL.md (185 lines - well under 500 line limit)
- references/query-templates.md - Complete search query patterns by intent type
- references/source-validation.md - Quality indicators and validation checklist
- references/output-format.md - Structured research output format with citations
- references/scenario-handling.md - Common research scenarios and handling strategies

**Key Features**:
- 6-phase workflow: Query Formulation → Source Prioritization → Search Execution → Content Fetching → Source Validation → Synthesis
- Source priority matrix (Official docs → GitHub → Blogs → Stack Overflow → Community → General)
- Query templates for official docs, tutorials, troubleshooting, comparisons, GitHub, versions, APIs
- Validation checklist with quality indicators (date, author, engagement, version, domain, updates)
- Scenario handling (outdated info, conflicts, no results, paywalls, version mismatch, multiple valid approaches)
- Output format with citations, findings, conflict resolution, caveats, recommendations

**Tools**: WebSearch, WebFetch, Read, Write, TodoWrite, AskUserQuestion

**Next Steps**:
- GREEN phase: Verify skill works with test scenario
- REFACTOR phase: Pressure test with subagents
- Update researching-skills gateway routing (when router refactor happens)
