# Changelog

## 2026-01-22 - Initial Creation

**RED Phase Evidence:**
- Gap: No existing skill covers drill-down/drill-up navigation in clustered graphs
- Failure scenario: Developer implements breadcrumb navigation without guidance
- Expected failures: Re-render cascades, broken back button, lost selections, jarring transitions
- Codebase evidence: `modules/chariot/ui/src/hooks/useGraphClustering.ts` disabled with no navigation patterns

**Category:** development/frontend/graphing

**Skill Type:** Process/Pattern

**Key Patterns:**
- Breadcrumb state management with immutable updates
- Camera animation timing (500ms drill-down, 300ms drill-up)
- URL state synchronization with browser history
- Per-level selection preservation
- Performance thresholds (1K/10K node breakpoints)
- Table fallback integration

**Research Sources:**
- Cambridge Intelligence: Progressive Disclosure
- Nielsen Norman Group: Progressive Disclosure
- Sigma.js Performance Issue #567
- yFiles Large Graph Performance

**Integration:**
- Requires: preventing-react-hook-infinite-loops, working-with-sigma-js
- Pairs with: coordinating-competing-systems, prefetching-react-routes, graph-layout-coordination
