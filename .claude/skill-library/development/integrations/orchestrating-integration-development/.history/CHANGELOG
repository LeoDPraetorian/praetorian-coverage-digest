# Changelog

## 2026-01-21 - Initial Skill Creation (16-Phase OMAW-Aligned Structure)

**Change**: Created orchestrating-integration-development2 skill with full 16-phase structure aligned with orchestrating-multi-agent-workflows (OMAW)

**Motivation**: The original orchestrating-integration-development used a 13-phase structure. OID2 aligns with OMAW's 16-phase template for consistency across all orchestration skills while preserving integration-specific content (P0 compliance, vendor skills, CheckAffiliation).

### Files Created

**Core Skill:**
- SKILL.md (234 lines) - Main orchestration guide with 16-phase structure

**Phase Reference Files:**
- phase-1-setup.md (227 lines) - Worktree creation, output directory, MANIFEST.yaml
- phase-2-triage.md (221 lines) - Work type classification (SMALL/MEDIUM/LARGE)
- phase-3-codebase-discovery.md (293 lines) - Integration pattern discovery

- phase-6-brainstorming.md (237 lines) - Design refinement (LARGE only)
- phase-7-architecture-plan.md (336 lines) - Architecture + task decomposition
- phase-8-implementation.md (311 lines) - Code development with P0 patterns
- phase-9-design-verification.md (313 lines) - Plan verification
- phase-10-domain-compliance.md (344 lines) - P0 validation (7 requirements)
- phase-11-code-quality.md (378 lines) - Two-stage gated review
- phase-12-test-planning.md (316 lines) - Test strategy with test-lead
- phase-13-testing.md (396 lines) - Test implementation and execution
- phase-14-coverage-verification.md (288 lines) - Coverage check (≥80%)
- phase-15-test-quality.md (351 lines) - Test quality validation
- phase-16-completion.md (231 lines) - PR, cleanup, frontend (conditional)

**Supporting References:**
- compaction-gates.md (193 lines) - Integration-specific compaction protocol
- checkpoint-configuration.md (207 lines) - Human checkpoint strategy
- rationalization-table.md (103 lines) - P0 rationalization prevention

**Total: 20 files, ~5,500 lines**

### Key Integration-Specific Content

**P0 Compliance (Phase 10):**
| # | Requirement | Purpose |
|---|-------------|---------|
| 1 | VMFilter | Asset filtering before Job.Send() |
| 2 | CheckAffiliation | Real API query, not stub |
| 3 | ValidateCredentials | First call in Invoke() |
| 4 | errgroup Safety | SetLimit + captured loop variables |
| 5 | Pagination Safety | maxPages OR API-provided limit |
| 6 | Error Handling | No ignored errors, wrapped context |
| 7 | File Size | ≤400 lines per file |

**Compaction Gates:**
- Gate 1: After Phase 3 (Codebase Discovery)
- Gate 2: After Phase 8 (Implementation)
- Gate 3: After Phase 13 (Testing)

**Human Checkpoints:**
- Phase 4: Vendor skill creation decision
- Phase 7: Architecture approval
- Phase 10: P0 violations
- Phase 16: Final approval

### Phase Skip Matrix

| Work Type | Skipped Phases |
|-----------|----------------|
| SMALL | 6, 7, 9, 12 |
| MEDIUM | 6 |
| LARGE | None (all 16) |

### Compliance

- ✅ SKILL.md: 234 lines (under 500-line limit)
- ✅ All reference files under 400-line limit
- ✅ All 16 phases have reference files
- ✅ Foundational references point to OMAW
- ✅ Integration-specific content preserved from OID

### Architecture Decisions

1. **16-Phase Structure**: Matches OMAW for consistency, not OID's 13-phase
2. **Phase 10 = Domain Compliance**: P0 validation is integration-specific domain compliance
3. **Two-Stage Code Quality**: Stage 1 (spec compliance) blocking, Stage 2 (quality + security) parallel
4. **Conditional Frontend**: Phase 16 asks about UI needs, spawns frontend-developer if needed

### Verification

- ✅ All phase files created (16/16)
- ✅ All files under line limits
- ✅ SKILL.md references all phase files
- ✅ Foundational references point to OMAW equivalents
- ✅ P0 requirements documented in Phase 10
