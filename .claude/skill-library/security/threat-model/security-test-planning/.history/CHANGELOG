## 2026-01-10 - Fix Path and Session Variable Inconsistencies

### Changed
- **SKILL.md**: Replaced 2 occurrences of `.claude/.threat-model/{session}` with `.claude/.output/threat-modeling/{timestamp}-{slug}`
- **references/output-schemas.md**: Replaced 1 path occurrence + 2 variable occurrences (`{session}` and `{session-id}`)
- **references/workflow.md**: Replaced 4 path occurrences + 5 variable occurrences

### Rationale
- Standardizes output directory path with threat-modeling-orchestrator skill conventions
- Uses consistent `{timestamp}-{slug}` session identifier format from persisting-agent-outputs skill
- Aligns with established `.claude/.output/` convention for orchestrator outputs
- Updates both path references and session labels in report templates

### Files Affected
- SKILL.md (379 lines - unchanged)
- references/output-schemas.md (237 lines - unchanged)
- references/workflow.md (310 lines - unchanged)

### Total Changes
- 7 path replacements across 3 files
- 9 variable replacements (both `{session}` and `{session-id}`) across 3 files

## 2026-01-10 - Phase Reference Corrections

**Changed**:
- Fixed consumer description (line 20): Changed "threat-modeling-orchestrator skill in Phase 7 (future test execution)" to "threat-modeling-orchestrator and downstream CI/CD automation" - removed non-existent Phase 7 reference
- Fixed phase failure message (line 124): Changed "Phase 4 has FAILED" to "Phase 6 has FAILED" - corrected to match that security-test-planning IS Phase 6

**Rationale**:
- Phase 7 does not exist in the threat modeling workflow (phases are 1-6)
- security-test-planning is Phase 6, not Phase 4
- These corrections align with the corrected phase numbering in threat-modeling-orchestrator

**Line Count**: 379 lines (unchanged)
