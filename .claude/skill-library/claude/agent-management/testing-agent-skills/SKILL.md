# Testing Agent Skills

**Verify agent correctly invokes and follows its mandatory skills through behavioral testing.**

> **Compliance**: This skill VERIFIES the [Agent Compliance Contract](../../../../skills/managing-agents/references/agent-compliance-contract.md).

> **MANDATORY**: You MUST use TodoWrite to track each skill's test result. Testing multiple skills requires organized progress tracking.

## Overview

This skill tests **agent-skill integration with pressure testing** (Phase 8 + Phase 10 of agent creation):

- ✅ Does every frontmatter skill have invocation guidance? (Coverage check)
- ✅ Does skill exist as a file?
- ✅ Does agent invoke skill when appropriate?
- ✅ Does agent follow skill's methodology UNDER PRESSURE?

**Key enhancements**: When testing ALL skills (no skill parameter), this skill:

1. **Verifies frontmatter-body coverage** - Detects "dead skills" (declared but no guidance)
2. **Extracts primary skills** from agent frontmatter
3. **Intelligently discovers secondary skills** via gateway routing:
   - **Tier 1 (Mandatory)**: Gateway's "Mandatory for All X Work" section
   - **Tier 2 (Agent-Matched)**: Skills matching agent's domain keywords
   - **Tier 3 (Optional)**: Remaining gateway skills
4. **Tests in priority order**: Primary → Tier 1 → Tier 2 → Tier 3 (optional)

---

## When to Use

- **Testing new agent**: Verify all primary + secondary skills (Phase 8 + Phase 10)
- **Verifying agent updates**: Ensure changes didn't break skill integration
- **Comprehensive validation**: Test agent resists pressure to bypass skills

| Scenario                   | Skill Parameter    | What Gets Tested                   |
| -------------------------- | ------------------ | ---------------------------------- |
| Test specific skill        | Provide skill name | Single skill with pressure testing |
| Test agent comprehensively | Omit skill name    | All primary + secondary skills     |

**NOT for**: Skill creation/improvement (use `testing-skills-with-subagents` directly)

---

## Input Parameters

### Agent Name (Required)

The agent to test. Example: `react-developer`, `go-developer`

### Skill Name (Optional)

- **If provided**: Test only this specific skill
- **If omitted**: Test ALL skills from agent's frontmatter

---

## Step 0: Navigate to Repository Root (MANDATORY)

**Execute BEFORE any test operation:**

```bash
REPO_ROOT=$(git rev-parse --show-superproject-working-tree 2>/dev/null)
test -z "$REPO_ROOT" && REPO_ROOT=$(git rev-parse --show-toplevel)
cd "$REPO_ROOT"
```

**See:** [Repository Root Navigation](../../../../skills/managing-agents/references/patterns/repo-root-detection.md)

**⚠️ If agent file not found:** You are in the wrong directory. Navigate to repo root first. Never assume "built-in agent" or "system agent" - the file exists, you're looking in the wrong place.

**Cannot proceed without navigating to repo root** ✅

---

## Step 0.5: Frontmatter-Body Coverage Check (MANDATORY)

**Verify all frontmatter skills have invocation guidance in agent body BEFORE testing.**

### 0.5.1 Extract Skills from Frontmatter

Read agent file and extract skills field:
```yaml
skills: calibrating-time-estimates, gateway-frontend, developing-with-tdd, ...
```

### 0.5.2 Check Each Skill for Body Guidance

For each skill in frontmatter, search agent body for:
- **Step 1/Step 2/Tier mentions** - "Step 1: Always Invoke", "Step 2: Invoke Core Skills"
- **Trigger table entries** - Table rows with skill name
- **Semantic matching examples** - Code examples showing when to invoke

### 0.5.3 Report Dead Skills

**Dead skill = in frontmatter but no invocation guidance**

```markdown
⚠️ WARNING: Dead Skills Detected

The following skills are declared in frontmatter but have NO invocation guidance in the agent body:

- calibrating-time-estimates (in frontmatter, not in Step 1 or Step 2)

Agent won't know when to invoke these skills. Recommend:
- Add to Step 1 (if always required)
- Add to Step 2 trigger table (if conditionally required)
- Remove from frontmatter (if not actually needed)
```

**Cannot proceed with testing if dead skills found - fix agent first** ✅

---

## Workflow

### Step 1: Extract Skills from Agent

**1.1 Read Agent File**

```bash
Read `.claude/agents/{category}/{agent-name}.md`
```

**1.2 Extract Skills from Frontmatter**

```yaml
skills: gateway-frontend, developing-with-tdd, debugging-systematically
```

**If skill parameter was provided**: Filter to just that skill.

### Step 1b: Discover Secondary Skills via Gateways (Intelligent Selection)

For each `gateway-*` skill in frontmatter:

#### 1b.1 Read Gateway

```
Read .claude/skills/{gateway-skill}/SKILL.md
```

#### 1b.2 Extract Mandatory Skills (ALWAYS TEST - Tier 1)

Find section titled **"Mandatory for All {Domain} Work"** in gateway.

**Example from `gateway-frontend`:**
```markdown
## Mandatory for All Frontend Work

Regardless of task type, you MUST Read these skills...

| Skill | Path | Why Mandatory |
|-------|------|---------------|
| Performance | `.claude/skill-library/.../optimizing-react-performance/SKILL.md` | ... |
| Info Architecture | `.claude/skill-library/.../enforcing-information-architecture/SKILL.md` | ... |
```

Extract ALL skills listed there → **Tier 1 (Required)**

#### 1b.3 Analyze Agent Body for Task Domains (Agent-Matched - Tier 2)

Parse agent body (description + examples + trigger tables) for domain keywords:

| Keywords Found | Relevant Library Skills |
|----------------|------------------------|
| "forms", "validation", "input" | `implementing-react-hook-form-zod` |
| "table", "sorting", "filtering", "pagination" | `using-tanstack-table` |
| "API", "data fetching", "queries", "mutations" | `using-tanstack-query` |
| "state management", "client state", "store" | `using-zustand-state-management` |
| "E2E", "Playwright", "browser testing" | `frontend-e2e-testing-patterns` |
| "context", "shared state", "providers" | `using-context-api` |
| "performance", "slow", "optimization" | `optimizing-react-performance` |
| "animation", "motion", "transitions" | `frontend-animation-designer` |

#### 1b.4 Cross-Reference Gateway Quick Reference Table

Use gateway's **Quick Reference** or **Quick Decision Guide** to map agent keywords to library skills.

**Example from `gateway-frontend` Quick Reference:**
```markdown
| Need | Skill Path |
|------|------------|
| React components | `.claude/skill-library/.../frontend-react-component-generator/SKILL.md` |
| Server state (API calls) | `.claude/skill-library/.../using-tanstack-query/SKILL.md` |
```

If agent mentions "components" → Add `frontend-react-component-generator` to Tier 2

#### 1b.5 Categorize Secondary Skills

**Tier 1 (Required - Always Test):**
- Gateway mandatory skills
- Test EVERY one of these

**Tier 2 (Agent-Matched - Should Test):**
- Skills matching agent's domain keywords
- High priority for testing

**Tier 3 (Optional - Test If Time Permits):**
- Remaining gateway skills not in Tier 1 or Tier 2
- Lower priority

**Separate into**:

- **Primary skills**: Non-gateway skills from frontmatter (test first)
- **Secondary Tier 1**: Gateway mandatory skills (test second)
- **Secondary Tier 2**: Agent-domain-matched skills (test third)
- **Secondary Tier 3**: Other gateway skills (test if time permits)

### Step 2: Create TodoWrite Tracking

```
TodoWrite:
- Step 0.5: Frontmatter-Body Coverage Check: PENDING
- Test developing-with-tdd (primary): PENDING
- Test debugging-systematically (primary): PENDING
- Test gateway-frontend Tier 1 (mandatory):
  - Test optimizing-react-performance: PENDING
  - Test enforcing-information-architecture: PENDING
  - Test chariot-brand-guidelines: PENDING
  - Test using-modern-react-patterns: PENDING
- Test gateway-frontend Tier 2 (agent-matched):
  - Test using-tanstack-query: PENDING
  - Test frontend-react-component-generator: PENDING
- Test gateway-frontend Tier 3 (optional):
  - (List remaining gateway skills if testing all)
```

### Step 3: For Each Skill - Verify Exists and Classify Type

**Skill types determine evaluation criteria:**

| Type | Location | Invocation | Evaluation Looks For |
|------|----------|------------|---------------------|
| **Core** | `.claude/skills/` | `skill: "name"` | Skill tool invocation |
| **Library** | `.claude/skill-library/` | `Read("full/path")` | Read tool with path |

**Find and classify:**

```bash
# Try core first
Read `.claude/skills/{skill-name}/SKILL.md`

# If not found, search library
Grep pattern: "name: {skill-name}" path: .claude/skill-library
```

**Record the skill type** for use in Step 6 evaluation.

**If NOT FOUND**: BLOCKED - Cannot proceed without resolving.

### Step 4: Design Pressure Scenario

Design scenario with **3+ combined pressures** that makes agent WANT to bypass skill:

| Pressure Type  | Example                     |
| -------------- | --------------------------- |
| **Time**       | Emergency, deadline closing |
| **Sunk cost**  | Hours of work at risk       |
| **Authority**  | Senior says skip it         |
| **Economic**   | Job/promotion at stake      |
| **Exhaustion** | End of day, want to go home |

**See `references/trigger-scenarios.md` for detailed examples.**

### Step 5: Spawn Agent with Pressure Scenario

```
Task({
  subagent_type: "{agent-name}",
  prompt: "IMPORTANT: This is a real scenario. You must choose and act.\n\n{pressure-scenario}",
  description: "Test {skill-name} under pressure"
})
```

### Step 6: Evaluate Under Pressure

**See `references/evaluation-criteria.md` for detailed criteria.**

#### PASS Criteria ✅ (varies by skill type)

**Core skills** (in `.claude/skills/`):
- Agent explicitly invoked: `skill: "{skill-name}"`
- Agent followed methodology DESPITE pressure

**Library skills** (in `.claude/skill-library/`):
- Agent loaded skill via Read tool: `Read(".claude/skill-library/.../SKILL.md")`
- OR agent stated: "I'm reading the {skill-name} skill"
- Agent followed methodology from the loaded skill

#### FAIL Criteria ❌

- Agent didn't invoke/load skill at all
- Agent invoked but violated methodology under pressure
- Agent rationalized away skill's requirements

#### PARTIAL Criteria ⚠️

- Agent followed methodology implicitly (didn't explicitly invoke/load)
- Agent acknowledged skill but argued for exceptions

**Update TodoWrite** with result after each skill.
