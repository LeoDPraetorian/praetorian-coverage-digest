## [Initial Creation] - 2025-12-30

**TDD Phase: RED**

### Gap Documented

When creating skills that need academic backing (e.g., LLM fingerprinting, security research, AI agents), there was no documented workflow for searching arxiv.org academic papers. This created:

1. Skills lacking academic grounding and peer-reviewed foundations
2. Agents using ad-hoc approaches instead of proven techniques
3. No consistent methodology for formulating academic search queries
4. No standard output format for research synthesis

**Failure scenario captured:**
- User: "Create a skill for LLM fingerprinting"
- Agent: Uses WebSearch for "LLM fingerprinting" → gets blog posts, not peer-reviewed papers
- Result: Skill built on ad-hoc techniques instead of validated research

### Skill Details

- **Category:** Library skill - claude/skill-management/
- **Type:** Process/Pattern (research methodology)
- **Integration:** Sibling to researching-protocols, used by creating-skills Phase 6
- **Line count:** 448 lines (within 500 line limit)

### Features Created

1. 5-phase workflow: Query Formulation → Search Execution → Paper Analysis → Synthesis → Recommendation
2. arxiv.org Search API documentation with URL patterns
3. Academic vs colloquial terminology guide
4. Structured output format with arxiv ID citations
5. Common search patterns by topic (LLM Security, AI Agents, RAG, etc.)
6. Quality indicators for paper selection
7. Integration with researching-skills workflow

## [GREEN Phase Verified] - 2025-12-30

**TDD Phase: GREEN**

### Audit Results

- ✅ Passed audit with 2 warnings (line count: 463, orphan detection: expected)
- ✅ 3 INFO-level issues (minor formatting)
- ✅ All structural phases compliant
- ✅ Progressive disclosure implemented (SKILL.md + 3 reference files)

### Verification

- Created comprehensive references:
  - query-formulation.md - Academic terminology patterns
  - paper-analysis.md - Rapid and deep analysis techniques
  - citation-standards.md - arxiv ID formatting standards
- Line count: 463 (within 500 limit, room for growth)
- All required sections present and complete

## [REFACTOR Phase Decision] - 2025-12-30

**TDD Phase: REFACTOR - NOT REQUIRED**

### Pressure Testing Assessment

Per `testing-skills-with-subagents` guidance, this skill is categorized as:

**Reference skill (research methodology) - NOT a discipline skill**

**Why pressure testing is not applicable:**

1. **No compliance costs** - Research improves outcomes, agents don't resist
2. **No shortcuts to rationalize** - Unlike "skip tests to save time"
3. **No rules to violate** - Provides helpful workflow, not enforcement

**From testing-skills-with-subagents:**

> Don't test:
> - Pure reference skills (API docs, syntax guides)
> - Skills without rules to violate
> - Skills agents have no incentive to bypass

**Skill Type Classification:**

- ❌ Discipline-enforcing (requires pressure testing)
- ✅ Methodology/Reference (verification via audit sufficient)

**Verification Strategy Used:**

- ✅ Structural audit (22 phases)
- ✅ Progressive disclosure compliance
- ✅ Documentation completeness
- ✅ Integration clarity (with researching-skills)

### Conclusion

Skill is COMPLETE and VERIFIED without pressure testing. This is the appropriate verification strategy for reference/methodology skills.
