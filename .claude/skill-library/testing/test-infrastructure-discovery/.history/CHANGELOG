# Changelog - test-infrastructure-discovery

## [Date: 2025-12-16]

### Changed
- Added reference to **frontend-testing-patterns** skill in "Integration with Other Skills" section
- Clarified that frontend-testing-patterns provides contract verification guidance for MSW handlers (verify real API contracts before mocking)

### Reason
- `mock-contract-validation` skill has been deprecated
- Contract verification guidance now consolidated in `frontend-testing-patterns` skill
- Ensure developers are directed to the correct skill for API contract verification when using MSW

### Line Count
- Before: 240 lines
- After: 241 lines
- Still within safe zone (<350 lines)

### REFACTOR
- Skipped: Change is purely cosmetic (reference update)
- Criteria: <10 lines, no behavioral change, no rule modifications
- No pressure testing needed for skill reference updates
