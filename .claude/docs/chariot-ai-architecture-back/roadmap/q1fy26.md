# Q1FY26 Roadmap

[ Back to Overview](../OVERVIEW.md)

**Theme: Disrupt Vulnerability Management**

With the core autonomous engine built and validated, Q1 is about scaling intelligence and preparing for enterprise prime time. We will transform Chariot into a true human-machine collaborative platform by empowering operators, launch a disruptive campaign against the vulnerability management market, introduce advanced new forms of agent intelligence, and harden the entire system for enterprise-grade deployments.

## Major Milestone

**Disrupt Vulnerability Management**: Launch a major initiative for AI to autonomously generate vulnerability signatures (e.g., Nuclei templates) directly from newly published CVEs. Features that other companies sell as standalone products serve as automated inputs to the Chariot engine.

By collapsing the vulnerability management toolchain directly into our platform, we create a rapid-response capability that legacy scanners cannot match. We move from being consumers of threat intelligence to producers of it.

## Empowering the Human Operator Planned

### Forging the Human-Machine Team

Deliver the Operator Workflow Builder - a rich, UI-based, drag-and-drop editor for codifying knowledge into reusable attack chains. Paired with Attack Path Visualization for transparent, auditable AI "thinking". Transform the platform from a black-box automation tool into a true collaborative "exoskeleton" for security professionals.

**Blocking Dependency**: Requires Workflow Engine which is NOT implemented. No Temporal.io integration, no React Flow UI builder.

### Operator's Workbench

| REQ ID     | Requirement                               | Rationale                                                                              | Status                   |
| ---------- | ----------------------------------------- | -------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- | ------------------------ |
| REQ-WF-007 | Registry-Backed Routing                   | Route execution requests to Aegis or Janus based on executor metadata                  | Routing exists in Agora  |
| REQ-WF-008 | Advanced Operator-Defined Workflow Engine | Support conditional logic (if/then/else), dynamic executor routing, execution triggers | Requires Workflow Engine |
| REQ-UI-010 | Define & Manage Attack Chains             | Create, view, edit, delete named workflow sequences with parameters and control flow   | Requires Workflow Engine |
| REQ-UI-011 | Implement Attack Path Visualization       | Real-time graph visualization of agent progress and decisions                          |                          |

### Advanced Workflow Engine Capabilities

The workflow engine evolves to support:

1. **Conditional Logic**: Execute different capabilities based on previous step outcomes
2. **Dynamic Executor Routing**: Route individual capability requests to Janus or Aegis based on registry metadata
3. **Execution Triggers**: Workflows initiated via UI or Platform API

This transforms the simple sequential "script runner" into a true orchestration engine with sophisticated, real-world logic.

---

## Advanced Agent Intelligence Partial

Significantly upgrade the platform's core intelligence by implementing the Attack Graph Service (AGS) for strategic reasoning about optimal attack paths, and delivering a Task Recommendation Engine to improve decision-making speed and efficiency.

**Implementation Status**: RAG integration found implemented (pgvector on Aurora). Attack Graph Service NOT started - critical for strategic attack path planning.

### Requirements

| REQ ID                       | Requirement                                  | Rationale                                                                                                | Status                      |
| ---------------------------- | -------------------------------------------- | -------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- | --------------------------- |
| REQ-TASK-004                 | Task Recommendation Engine                   | Context-based task suggestions as capabilities grow into hundreds; pre-filter for high-probability tasks | Missing intent-based search |
| REQ-GRAPH-001, REQ-GRAPH-002 | Implement the Attack Graph Service (AGS)     | Query for optimal attack paths to high-value objectives; strategic multi-step planning                   | Not started                 |
| REQ-UI-014                   | AI Performance Dashboard                     | Track AutoTriage precision/recall against human judgments over time                                      |                             |
| REQ-AGENT-013                | Integrate RAG into Agent Orchestration Layer | Retrieval-Augmented Generation for grounding reasoning in factual, real-time data                        | Found implemented           |
| REQ-AGENT-014                | Implement External Memory Mechanisms         | Vector database/key-value store for long-term context; Summary Injection for preventing forgetting       | pgvector exists             |

### RAG Integration Details

Enhance Planner Agent and Specialized Sub-Agents with RAG mechanisms:

- Query internal/external knowledge bases (S3 Telemetry Data Lake, Neo4j, NVD/CVE feeds)
- Augment LLM prompts with retrieved information
- Support vector embeddings and semantic search
- Framework-agnostic design aligned with abstraction layer
- Safeguards against OWASP LLM08:2025 embedding vulnerabilities

**Impact**: RAG addresses key LLM limitations (hallucinations, nondeterminism, outdated knowledge) by grounding agent reasoning in factual data. Research shows 2x improvement in success rates for dynamic environments.

### External Memory Details

Enhance Prometheus with external memory modules:

- Persist agent states, past actions, retrieved knowledge
- Query/write to memory during reasoning loops
- Summary Injection for compressed summaries of prior steps
- Selective memory access via semantic search
- Encryption and access controls for data protection

**Impact**: External memory improves consistency by 20-30% in complex scenarios like lateral movement, addressing context loss in multistage attacks.

## Enterprise Readiness & Platform Hardening Planned

Prepare for wider adoption and more complex engagements with full-stack observability, secure audit trails, and disaster recovery plans.
