## [Date: 2025-12-23] - Initial Creation

### Created
- Skill created via creating-skills workflow
- RED failure documented: Manual gateway sync takes 20-30 minutes and is error-prone
- Category: claude/skill-management (library)
- Type: Process/Pattern (instruction-based, uses Glob, Read, Edit tools)
- Line count: 334 lines (target: 300-450)

### Problem Solved
When library skills are added, renamed, or deleted, gateway routing tables become stale:
- Orphaned skills: Library skills not listed in any gateway
- Broken paths: Gateway references to deleted/renamed skills
- Duplicate entries: Same skill in multiple gateways

### Operations Supported
1. --dry-run: Preview changes without applying
2. --full-sync: Sync all 8 gateways with library
3. --gateway <name>: Sync specific gateway only

### TDD Phases Completed
- 🔴 RED: Manual sync process documented as error-prone and time-consuming
- 🟢 GREEN: Skill created with comprehensive workflow and references
- 🔵 REFACTOR: Anti-rationalization patterns added to Critical Rules section

### References Created
- gateway-mapping.md - Complete path-to-gateway mapping rules
- sync-algorithm.md - Detailed comparison logic
- routing-table-format.md - Exact formatting requirements
- error-recovery.md - Handling edge cases

### Examples Created
- dry-run-output.md - Sample dry-run report
- full-sync-output.md - Sample full-sync report
- gateway-sync-output.md - Sample single-gateway sync

### Gateway Updated
- Added to gateway-claude routing table (Skill Management section)
