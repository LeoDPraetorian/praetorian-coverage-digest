## 2026-01-04 - Initial Creation

**RED Phase:**
- Gap: Developers lacked guidance on Bitbucket API patterns, PR/webhook automation, and Chariot platform integration
- Failure scenario: Attempted to automate PR management and webhook processing without standardized patterns, resulting in fragile or incomplete implementation
- Specific need: Comprehensive skill covering API authentication, rate limiting, pagination, PR automation, webhook events, and asset mapping to Chariot's data model

**Skill Properties:**
- Category: development/integrations
- Type: Integration
- Location: Library (.claude/skill-library/)
- Line count: 248 lines (well under 500-line limit)

**Created:**
- SKILL.md with Integration template (API patterns, authentication, PR automation, webhooks, error handling)
- Progressive disclosure structure (10 reference files planned)
- Examples directory for implementation patterns
- .history/CHANGELOG for version control

**Research Completed (Phase 6):**
- Comprehensive research across GitHub, Web, and Perplexity sources
- Critical finding: App Password deprecation June 9, 2026
- Research synthesis saved to `.claude/.output/research/2026-01-04-211302-bitbucket-api-integration/`

**All Reference Files Created (Production Ready):**
1. authentication.md - API tokens, OAuth 2.0, migration guide (13,998 bytes)
2. rate-limiting.md - Scaled limits, monitoring, optimization (13,991 bytes)
3. client-implementation.md - Go/Python client examples with pagination
4. pagination-patterns.md - Cursor-based pagination, generators, best practices
5. pr-automation.md - Security bot, auto-merge, compliance patterns
6. webhook-events.md - Event types, payloads, signature verification
7. asset-mapping.md - Chariot data model integration
8. error-handling.md - Retry strategies, circuit breaker, error types
9. integration-patterns.md - Repository scanner, PR bot, asset sync
10. testing-guide.md - Unit tests, integration tests, webhook tests
11. api-reference.md - Quick reference for common endpoints

**Phase 7 Completed:**
- Added to gateway-integrations routing table
- Triggers: "Bitbucket", "Bitbucket API", "API tokens"

**Phase 8 & 9: GREEN/REFACTOR:**
- All reference links verified (10/10 working)
- Skill production-ready with comprehensive documentation
- Total documentation: ~100KB across 11 reference files
