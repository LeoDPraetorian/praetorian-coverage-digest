## 2026-01-19 - Add (LIBRARY) Annotations to Library Skill References

**Changes:**
- Added (LIBRARY) annotation to `searching-skills` references (lines 34, 242, 249)
- Added (LIBRARY) annotation to `auditing-skills` references (lines 35, 243, 250)
- Updated table formatting in "Pairs With" section to accommodate longer skill names with annotations

**Rationale:**
- Phase 30 compliance requirement: All library skill references must be annotated with (LIBRARY)
- Distinguishes library skills from core skills for proper skill invocation
- `managing-skills` is a core skill and does not require annotation

**Impact:** Documentation clarity improvement, no functional changes

## 2026-01-19 - Step Numbering Normalization

**Changes:**
- Renamed "Step 0: Navigate to Repository Root" to "Step 1: Navigate to Repository Root"
- Incremented all subsequent step numbers by 1:
  - Step 1 → Step 2 (List Core Skills)
  - Step 2 → Step 3 (List Library Skills)
  - Step 3 → Step 4 (Check Status)
  - Step 4 → Step 5 (Format Output)

**Rationale:**
- Aligns with standard 1-indexed step numbering convention used across other skills
- Improves consistency and reduces confusion for agents following workflow

**Impact:** None functional, purely documentation consistency improvement
