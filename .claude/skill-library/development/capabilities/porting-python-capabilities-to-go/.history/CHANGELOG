# Changelog: porting-python-capabilities-to-go

## 2026-01-06 - Initial Creation

**RED Phase Documentation:**

**Gap Identified:** Current capability porting lacks structured orchestration. When porting Python security capabilities to Go, three library skills exist (mapping-python-dependencies, translating-python-idioms-to-go, verifying-port-equivalent) but aren't coordinated.

**Test Scenario:** User asks to "port Python S3 scanner capability to Go"

**Current Failure (without skill):**
- User manually invokes three skills (might skip or reorder phases)
- No blocking gates (continues despite incomplete outputs)
- Outputs scattered or forgotten
- No MANIFEST.yaml tracking workflow state
- Inline translation attempts miss dependency/idiom analysis
- No verification of behavioral equivalence

**Result:** Incomplete ports that compile but fail functionally.

**Skill Type:** Process/Pattern - Orchestration workflow

**Location:** Core (.claude/skills/) - orchestration skills belong in core, called by orchestrating-capability-development

**Structure:**
- 476 lines (within 500 limit)
- 3 phases with blocking gates
- Progressive disclosure with references/ directory prepared
- REQUIRED SUB-SKILLS table included
- Integration section complete
- Workflow diagram with gate checklists inline

**Next Steps:**
- Phase 6: Research (optional, skipping - skill is coordination wrapper)
- Phase 7: Gateway update (N/A - core skill)
- Phase 8: GREEN verification
- Phase 9: REFACTOR pressure testing
