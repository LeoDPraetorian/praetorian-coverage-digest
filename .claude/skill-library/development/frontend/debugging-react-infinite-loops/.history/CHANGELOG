# Changelog - debugging-react-infinite-loops

## 2026-01-24 - Initial Creation

**RED Failure**: Agent diagnosed React infinite loop using codebase-specific investigation rather than systematic pattern classification. Missing:
- Classification framework for 5 root causes (ranked by frequency)
- why-did-you-render tool setup
- Systematic debugging protocol
- Fix pattern library with before/after examples
- Decision tree for diagnosis

**Category**: development/frontend
**Skill Type**: Process/Pattern
**Location**: Library (.claude/skill-library/)

**Created**: 2026-01-24

**Research**: Skipped orchestrating-research - used existing web research from conversation start (7 sources: dmitripavlutin.com, logrocket.com, alexsidorenko.com, GitHub welldone-software, typeofnan.dev, maxrozen.com)

**Reference Files Created** (9 files, all < 400 lines):
- phase1-isolation.md (126 lines) - Binary elimination, stack trace analysis, render counter
- phase2-dependency-analysis.md (217 lines) - Console logging, deep comparison, isolation
- phase3-classification.md (247 lines) - 5 root cause categories ranked by frequency
- fix-object-deps.md (326 lines) - 6 fix patterns for object/array dependencies
- fix-self-referential.md (171 lines) - Functional updaters, conditional guards
- fix-function-deps.md (164 lines) - useCallback, hoisting, moving inside effect
- fix-missing-deps.md (95 lines) - Empty array vs specific dependencies
- fix-inline-handlers.md (123 lines) - Arrow functions, function references
- why-did-you-render-setup.md (308 lines) - Installation, configuration, interpretation

**GREEN Verification** (Phase 8): Agent spawned with skill loaded showed systematic classification approach vs codebase-specific investigation (RED phase). Agent followed 5-phase methodology, classified pattern as "Object/Array Dependencies", applied Fix Pattern 1 (remove redundant raw deps), and explicitly referenced skill sections. Behavioral change confirmed - skill works as intended.

**Gateway Update** (Phase 7): Added to `gateway-frontend` routing table with triggers: "debug loop", "too many re-renders", "maximum update depth". Positioned alongside existing `preventing-react-hook-infinite-loops` skill (prevention patterns vs debugging methodology).
