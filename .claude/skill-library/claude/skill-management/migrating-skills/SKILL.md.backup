# Migrating Skills

**Safe skill migration between core ↔ library with comprehensive updates.**

> **You MUST use TodoWrite** before starting to track all 9 steps. Missing steps can break skill discovery.

---

## What This Skill Does

Safely migrates skills by:

1. ✅ Navigating to repository root
2. ✅ Validating source skill exists
3. ✅ Determining target location
4. ✅ Moving directory to target
5. ✅ Updating gateway references
6. ✅ Updating command structural patterns (Core vs Library)
7. ✅ Updating invocation syntax (skill: vs Read)
8. ✅ Updating Related Skills and Integration references
9. ✅ Verifying no broken references

**Critical:** Core ↔ Library migration impacts skill discovery (token budget vs on-demand).

---

## When to Use

**Promote to Core (Library → Core):**

- Skill used frequently across projects
- High-value universal skill
- Core has available slots (<25 skills)

**Demote to Library (Core → Library):**

- Skill rarely used
- Domain-specific (not universal)
- Freeing Core slots for higher-priority skills

**NOT for:**

- Renaming skills (use `renaming-skills`)
- Creating skills (use `creating-skills`)
- Moving within library categories (manual `mv`)

## Migration Decision Matrix

| Factor          | Promote to Core     | Keep/Move to Library  |
| --------------- | ------------------- | --------------------- |
| Usage frequency | Every session       | Occasional            |
| Scope           | Universal           | Domain-specific       |
| Discovery       | Need auto-discovery | On-demand via gateway |
| Core slots      | Available           | Full (need to free)   |

---

## Step 1: Navigate to Repository Root (MANDATORY)

**Execute BEFORE any migrate operation:**

```bash
ROOT="$(git rev-parse --show-superproject-working-tree --show-toplevel | head -1)" && cd "$ROOT"
```

**See:** [Repository Root Navigation](../../../../../.claude/skills/managing-skills/references/patterns/repo-root-detection.md)

**⚠️ If skill file not found:** You are in the wrong directory. Navigate to repo root first. The file exists, you're just looking in the wrong place.

**Cannot proceed without navigating to repo root** ✅

---

## Workflow

Follow these 9 steps to safely migrate a skill between core and library locations. Each step is critical to prevent broken references and discovery failures.

### Step 2: Validate Source

**Check skill exists:**

```bash
# Core
ls .claude/skills/{skill-name}

# Library
find .claude/skill-library -name "{skill-name}" -type d
```

**Determine current location:**

- Record full path
- Note category if library skill

### Step 3: Determine Target

**If promoting to Core:**

```bash
# Check Core has space (<25 skills)
ls .claude/skills/ | wc -l

# Target: .claude/skills/{skill-name}
```

**If demoting to Library:**

```plaintext
Question: Which library category?
Options:
  - claude/skill-management
  - development/frontend
  - development/backend
  - testing
  - operations

# Target: .claude/skill-library/{category}/{skill-name}
```

### Step 4: Move Directory

**Create target if needed:**

```bash
mkdir -p {target-parent-dir}
```

**Move skill:**

```bash
mv {source-path} {target-path}
```

**Verify move:**

```bash
ls {target-path}  # Should exist
ls {source-path}  # Should error
```

### Step 5: Update Gateway References (Automated)

**Why gateways need updating:**

- **Promoting to Core (Library → Core):** The library gateway entry now points to a non-existent path (skill moved out of library) - becomes a "broken path" that needs removal
- **Demoting to Library (Core → Library):** The skill now exists in library but isn't in any gateway routing table - becomes an "orphaned skill" that needs addition

**How to update (automated):**

Use `syncing-gateways` skill to automatically detect and fix gateway inconsistencies:

```typescript
Read(".claude/skill-library/claude/skill-management/syncing-gateways/SKILL.md");
```

**What syncing-gateways does:**

1. **Library → Core migration:**
   - Detects old gateway entry has broken path (skill no longer in library)
   - Automatically removes stale entry from gateway
   - Skill becomes auto-discovered via core

2. **Core → Library migration:**
   - Detects new skill exists in library but not in gateway
   - Maps skill to appropriate gateway based on path pattern:
     - `development/frontend/*` → `gateway-frontend`
     - `development/backend/*` → `gateway-backend`
     - `testing/*` → `gateway-testing`
     - `security/*` → `gateway-security`
     - etc.
   - Automatically adds skill to correct gateway routing table

**Run sync after migration:**

After completing Step 4 (Move Directory), execute the `syncing-gateways` workflow to update all affected gateways automatically. This ensures gateway routing tables stay consistent with actual skill locations.

### Step 6: Update Command Structural Pattern

**Critical:** Commands that invoke the migrated skill need **structural changes**, not just path updates. Core and Library commands have different patterns.

#### 6.1 Find Command References

```typescript
Grep({
  pattern: "{skill-name}",
  path: ".claude/commands",
  output_mode: "files_with_matches",
});
```

#### 6.2 Apply Structural Updates

Commands need complete structural transformation (frontmatter, tools, body), not just path updates. Demoting requires removing `skills:` frontmatter and switching to `Read()` pattern. Promoting requires adding `skills:` frontmatter and switching to Skill tool pattern.

**See:** [references/command-pattern-transformations.md](references/command-pattern-transformations.md) for complete before/after examples.

### Step 7: Update Invocation Syntax

**Critical:** Skill invocation method changes based on location (two-tier system).

**If demoting to Library (Core → Library):**

Find all `skill:` references and change to `Read()`:

```typescript
// Find skill: invocations
Grep({
  pattern: "skill:\\s*[\"']?{skill-name}[\"']?",
  path: ".claude",
  output_mode: "content",
});
```

Update each reference:

```typescript
Edit({
  file_path: "{file-with-reference}",
  old_string: 'skill: "{skill-name}"',
  new_string: 'Read(".claude/skill-library/{cat}/{skill-name}/SKILL.md")',
});
```

**If promoting to Core (Library → Core):**

Find all `Read()` references and change to `skill:`:

```typescript
// Find Read() invocations
Grep({
  pattern: "Read\\([\"'].*/skill-library/.*/{skill-name}/SKILL\\.md[\"']\\)",
  path: ".claude",
  output_mode: "content",
});
```

Update each reference:

```typescript
Edit({
  file_path: "{file-with-reference}",
  old_string: 'Read(".claude/skill-library/{cat}/{skill-name}/SKILL.md")',
  new_string: 'skill: "{skill-name}"',
});
```

**Why this matters:**

- Core skills: Accessible via `skill:` (Skill tool)
- Library skills: Must use `Read()` (Read tool with full path)
- Wrong invocation method = skill fails after migration

### Step 8: Update Related Skills and Integration References

**Critical:** Other skills reference the migrated skill in Related Skills sections and Integration documentation. These need annotation and path updates.

#### 8.1 Find Related Skills References

```bash
# Find skills mentioning the migrated skill in Related Skills sections
grep -r "\`{skill-name}\`" .claude/ --include="*.md" | grep -i "related"
```

#### 8.2 Find Integration Section References

```bash
# Find integration documentation referencing the skill
grep -r "{skill-name}" .claude/ --include="*.md" 2>/dev/null | grep -E "(integration|reference)"
```

#### 8.3 Update Annotations

**If demoting to Library (Core → Library):**

Update each reference from:

```
- `{skill-name}` (CORE) - Description
```

To:

```
- `{skill-name}` (LIBRARY) - `Read(".claude/skill-library/{category}/{skill-name}/SKILL.md")` - Description
```

**If promoting to Core (Library → Core):**

Update each reference from:

```
- `{skill-name}` (LIBRARY) - `Read(".claude/skill-library/...")` - Description
```

To:

```
- `{skill-name}` (CORE) - Description
```

#### 8.4 Update Integration Tables

For integration-skills.md files, update the Type column:

**Demoting:**

```
| `{skill-name}` | (CORE) | Purpose |
```

→

```
| `{skill-name}` | (LIBRARY) `Read(...)` | Purpose |
```

**Promoting:**

```
| `{skill-name}` | (LIBRARY) `Read(...)` | Purpose |
```

→

```
| `{skill-name}` | (CORE) | Purpose |
```

#### 8.5 Update Agent and Documentation References

**Critical:** Agents spawn skills, documentation references them, tools may depend on them. Missing these references leaves broken paths after migration.

```bash
# Find agent files referencing the skill
grep -r "{skill-name}" .claude/agents/ --include="*.md"

# Find documentation referencing the skill
grep -r "{skill-name}" .claude/docs/ --include="*.md"

# Find tool files referencing the skill
grep -r "{skill-name}" .claude/tools/ --include="*.md"
```

Update each reference with correct path/invocation syntax based on migration direction:

- **Demoting to Library:** Update agent prompts to use `Read()` instead of `skill:`, update doc links to library path
- **Promoting to Core:** Update agent prompts to use `skill:` instead of `Read()`, update doc links to core path

### Step 9: Verify Integrity

**Search for old path:**

```typescript
Grep({
  pattern: "{old-path}",
  path: ".claude",
  output_mode: "files_with_matches",
});
```

**Expected:** Zero matches (or only documentation/changelog)

**Search for stale annotations:**

```bash
# If demoted: Should find no (CORE) annotations for this skill
grep -r "\`{skill-name}\` (CORE)" .claude/ --include="*.md"

# If promoted: Should find no (LIBRARY) annotations for this skill
grep -r "\`{skill-name}\` (LIBRARY)" .claude/ --include="*.md"
```

**Expected:** Zero matches (annotations updated to match new location)

**Test skill access:**

```typescript
// Core skill
skill: "{skill-name}"; // Should work

// Library skill
Read(".claude/skill-library/{cat}/{skill-name}/SKILL.md"); // Should work
```

| `renaming-skills` (LIBRARY) - `Read(".claude/skill-library/claude/skill-management/renaming-skills/SKILL.md")` | Skill needs name change without moving between core/library locations | Use when skill's name is misleading or needs update but location (core vs library) is correct. Example: Renaming `creating-mcp-tools` to `managing-mcp-tools` while staying in library. Do NOT use if also changing core ↔ library location. |
| `creating-skills` (LIBRARY) - `Read(".claude/skill-library/claude/skill-management/creating-skills/SKILL.md")` | Need to recreate skill from scratch at new location instead of moving | Use when migration would be more complex than recreation (e.g., skill needs complete rewrite, or has extensive dependencies that would break). Rare edge case - prefer migration for simple moves.                                           |
