## [2025-12-27] - Skill Integration Enhancement

### Changed

**Context**: Identified 8 missing skills that should be integrated into the agent based on semantic analysis of agent's responsibilities vs available skills.

**Changes Made**:
- Added 2 essential skills to Tier 1 (always-read):
  - `using-tanstack-query` (95% relevance) - Essential for testing TanStack Query integrations
  - `frontend-testing-patterns` (90% relevance) - Comprehensive Vitest + React Testing Library patterns

- Added 6 skills to Tier 3 (task-triggered):
  - `verifying-vitest-test-integrity` (85% relevance) - PR reviews and test quality validation
  - `implementing-react-hook-form-zod` (75% relevance) - Form testing with validation patterns
  - `vitest-prepush-testing` (70% relevance) - CI/CD pre-push hook configuration
  - `api-testing-patterns` (65% relevance) - API contract testing for MSW mocks
  - `using-eslint` (55% relevance) - Code quality linting for test files
  - `performance-testing` (50% relevance) - Load testing patterns for integration tests

**Rationale**:
- Agent's primary responsibility is testing TanStack Query integrations, but `using-tanstack-query` skill was not integrated
- `frontend-testing-patterns` provides foundational Vitest patterns that complement MSW-focused testing
- Tier 3 additions fill gaps in PR review, form testing, CI/CD integration, contract testing, linting, and performance testing

**Impact**:
- Increased skill integration from 18 to 26 skills
- Enhanced agent's capability to handle TanStack Query testing scenarios
- Improved test quality through PR review and integrity checking patterns
- Better CI/CD integration guidance for pre-push hooks
- Expanded coverage for form testing, API contracts, and performance testing

**Discovery Method**: Used `finding-skills-for-agents` skill with semantic reasoning to identify gaps

**Testing**: Skills added via minimal edits to Tier 1 and Tier 3 sections, verified all 8 skills present in file
