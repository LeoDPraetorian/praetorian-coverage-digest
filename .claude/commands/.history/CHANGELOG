# Changelog: skill-manager Command

## [Date: 2024-12-16]

### Changed
- Updated all 8 operation routing instructions to provide explicit paths instead of ambiguous "Invoke" language
- Changed from "ACTION: Invoke the `{operation}-skills` skill" to "ACTION: Read and follow the {operation}-skills skill" with explicit Path line
- Added explicit paths for:
  - create → `.claude/skills/creating-skills/SKILL.md` (core skill)
  - update → `.claude/skill-library/claude/skill-management/updating-skills/SKILL.md`
  - audit → `.claude/skill-library/claude/skill-management/auditing-skills/SKILL.md`
  - fix → `.claude/skill-library/claude/skill-management/fixing-skills/SKILL.md`
  - rename → `.claude/skill-library/claude/skill-management/renaming-skills/SKILL.md`
  - migrate → `.claude/skill-library/claude/skill-management/migrating-skills/SKILL.md`
  - search → `.claude/skill-library/claude/skill-management/searching-skills/SKILL.md`
  - list → `.claude/skill-library/claude/skill-management/listing-skills/SKILL.md`

### Reason
- Router provides complete routing information (fulfills router's responsibility)
- Eliminates ambiguity - agents know exactly where to go and how to access skills
- Works without requiring architecture knowledge (core vs library distinction)
- Prevents wasted time trying Skill tool for library skills
- Zero cognitive load - just read the path and execute

### Impact
- Line count: 179 → 187 lines (still well under 350 line threshold)
- Breaking: No - all paths are valid and skills exist
- Benefits: Fresh agents can immediately execute without understanding skill architecture

### REFACTOR
- Tests run: None - REFACTOR skipped (mechanical routing change)
- Rationale: This is a router providing mechanical instructions with no decision points or rationalization opportunities. Change makes instructions MORE explicit (reduces ambiguity), not less. No rules to bypass, no validation to skip.
