## [${TIMESTAMP}] - Compliance Audit Fix

### Fixed (Claude-Automated)
- Phase 13: Added explicit TodoWrite mandate at workflow start
  - Added: "> **You MUST use TodoWrite before starting** to track all 9 steps"
  - Ensures agents track progress through complex rename workflow
  
- Phase 14b: Added language tags to 9 code blocks
  - Changed unmarked blocks to `markdown`, `text`, `typescript`, `bash`
  - Improves syntax highlighting and readability

### Status
- ✅ Critical issues: 1 → 0 (Phase 13 resolved)
- ⚠️ Warnings remain: Phase 3 (word count - 591 words, acceptable for procedural skill)
- ℹ️ Info items: Phase 7 (.local/.gitignore), Phase 14a/c (formatting)

### Method
- Backup: 2025-12-26-12-57-26-pre-fix.bak
- Tool: Claude Edit tool (semantic fixes)
- Verification: Re-audit passed with warnings only
