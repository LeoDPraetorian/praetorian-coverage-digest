## [Date: 2024-12-24] - Initial Creation

### Created

- Skill created via creating-skills workflow
- RED failure documented: Reviewer agents lack consolidated React 19 conventions, leading to inconsistent code reviews
- Category: development/frontend/patterns
- Type: Process/Pattern (code review methodology)

### Content Structure

**SKILL.md (473 lines)**:
- Quick Reference table (BLOCK/REQUEST CHANGE/VERIFY PRESENT categories)
- Prohibited Patterns (React.FC, forwardRef, useEffect setState, Zustand without selectors, data fetching in useEffect)
- Warning Patterns (useMemo/useCallback/React.memo without justification)
- Required Patterns (function declarations, TanStack Query, Zustand selectors, key prop)
- Reviewer Checklist

**References**:
- `anti-patterns.md` - Complete "You Might Not Need an Effect" patterns extracted from using-modern-react-patterns skill
- `prohibited-patterns.md` - Detailed rationale for React.FC, forwardRef, and unnecessary memoization prohibitions
- `required-patterns.md` - Comprehensive examples of all required patterns with complete code samples
- `reviewer-checklist.md` - Copyable checklist template with fast-fail search commands and approval criteria

### Source Attribution

Content consolidated from:
- `.claude/skill-library/development/frontend/patterns/using-modern-react-patterns/SKILL.md` (lines 143-335)
- React 19 official documentation
- React team recommendations
- Chariot platform conventions

### Purpose

**For**: Frontend reviewer agents (frontend-reviewer, code-reviewer)
**Goal**: Single source of truth for React 19 pattern enforcement during code review
**Impact**: Consistent code reviews, reduced React anti-patterns, better enforcement of platform conventions
