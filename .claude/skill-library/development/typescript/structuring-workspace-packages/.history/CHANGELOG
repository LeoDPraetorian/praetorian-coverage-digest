## [Initial Creation] - 2025-12-26

**RED Phase Documentation:**

During TypeScript workspace refactoring session, discovered multiple packages using anti-patterns:
- Relative path imports across packages (e.g., `import * as formatter from '../../../formatting-skill-output/...'`)
- Namespace imports instead of named imports
- Missing `exports` field in package.json
- Inconsistent moduleResolution settings

**Failure Behavior Without Skill:**
Claude doesn't know to check for these anti-patterns when refactoring TypeScript workspaces, leading to fragile code that works with tsx but violates npm workspace best practices.

**Evidence:**
Manual discovery and fix took ~2 hours through web research and trial-and-error.
