# Changelog

## 2025-12-27 - Initial Creation

**RED Phase Documentation:**
- Gap identified: CLAUDE.md had stale hardcoded list of 45 allowedColumns (actual: 204 fields)
- Developers lacked guidance on Query/Node/Relationship/Filter structure
- No documentation on dynamic field validation
- Frontend developers using useMy/useGraphQuery had no reference for constructing queries

**Category:** development/frontend (Library skill)
**Skill Type:** Library/Framework

**Initial Structure:**
- SKILL.md (331 lines) - Core reference with query structure, operators, patterns
- references/filter-operators.md - All 13 operators with examples
- references/query-patterns.md - 15 query patterns for common use cases
- references/dynamic-field-validation.md - Field lookup strategies

**Key Design Decisions:**
- Emphasizes dynamic field validation (grep against source file)
- Never hardcode field lists - they drift
- Source of truth: modules/chariot/backend/pkg/query/allowed_columns.go
- Targets frontend-developer agent using useMy/useGraphQuery hooks
