# Changelog

All notable changes to the orchestrating-fingerprintx-development skill will be documented in this file.

## [Initial Creation] - 2025-12-30

### Added

- Initial creation of orchestrating-fingerprintx-development skill
- 7-phase workflow with enforced gates (Protocol Research, Version Marker Research)
- Integration with three sub-skills: researching-protocols, researching-version-markers, writing-fingerprintx-modules
- TodoWrite tracking for all phases
- Comprehensive gate enforcement with rationalization prevention
- Output artifact templates and persistence strategy
- Progressive disclosure with references/ for detailed content

### Context

**RED Phase Failure Documentation**:

Current state: Fingerprintx development uses three advisory skills that say "do X first" but don't ENFORCE the workflow.

Result without this orchestrator:
- Developers skip directly to implementation without protocol research
- Missing version detection because version marker research was skipped
- Imprecise CPEs (mysql:* instead of mysql:8.0.23)
- Failed plugins that don't handle edge cases
- Technical debt with ~10% fix rate

This orchestrator makes research BLOCKING - cannot proceed to implementation until research outputs exist and pass gate conditions.
