# Changelog - brainstorming

## 2026-01-10 - Prompt Engineering Integration

**Type:** Enhancement

**Changes:**
- Added Integration section with reference to orchestration-prompt-patterns library skill
- Enhanced "Understanding the idea" section with Progressive Disclosure pattern (4 levels: Orientation, Constraints, Decisions, Details)
- Enhanced "Exploring approaches" section with Chain-of-Thought reasoning structure (5-step systematic evaluation)
- Added 3 new Key Principles: Progressive disclosure, Chain-of-thought for options, Self-consistency
- Added Anti-Patterns table with 5 common mistakes and correct approaches

**Rationale:**
Integrates formal prompt engineering patterns from orchestration-prompt-patterns to provide structured questioning discipline, preventing:
- Jumping to implementation details without establishing context
- Overwhelming users with multiple questions in single messages
- Presenting options without systematic trade-off analysis
- First-impression bias in recommendations

**Impact:**
- Questions now follow explicit 4-level progression (Orientation → Constraints → Decisions → Details)
- Options require step-by-step reasoning and self-consistency checks
- Clear anti-patterns help agents avoid common brainstorming failures
