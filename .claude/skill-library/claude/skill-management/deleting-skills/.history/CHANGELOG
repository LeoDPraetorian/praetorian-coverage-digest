# Changelog - deleting-skills

## [Date: 2025-12-16] - Initial Creation

### Created
- Skill created via creating-skills workflow
- RED failure documented: No systematic workflow for safe skill deletion (orphaned references, no impact analysis, no verification)
- Category: claude/skill-management
- Type: process/pattern
- Line count: 443 lines (within safe zone)

### Phases Implemented
1. Validate - Verify skill exists
2. Discover - Find all references (gateways, commands, skills)
3. Analyze - Show impact to user
4. Confirm - User approval before deletion
5. Remove - Delete skill directory with safety checks
6. Cleanup - Remove references systematically
7. Verify - Ensure no orphaned references remain

### Safety Features
- Mandatory user confirmation before deletion
- Path safety check (must contain `.claude/skill`)
- Comprehensive reference discovery
- Verification phase ensures no orphans
- TodoWrite tracking for all phases

### REFACTOR
- Tests run: [Time pressure + exhaustion, Authority pressure + "already checked"]
- Scenario 1: Agent chose full workflow despite exhaustion and time pressure (PASSED)
- Scenario 2: Agent chose full workflow despite senior engineers saying "it's unused" (PASSED)
- All tests: PASSED
- Counter-rationalizations added: None needed (workflow structure prevents bypass)
