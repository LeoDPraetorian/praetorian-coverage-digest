## [2025-12-24] - Initial Creation

### Created

- Skill created via creating-skills workflow
- RED failure documented: Pre-push hook using `vitest --changed --run` found zero tests after commit, allowing regressions
- Category: testing (library)
- Type: Process/Pattern

### Content

- SKILL.md (315 lines) - Main documentation
- references/stdin-parsing.md - Detailed git pre-push stdin format examples
- references/ci-integration.md - CI/CD pipeline patterns for GitHub Actions, GitLab CI, CircleCI

### Problem Addressed

The `vitest --changed` flag without a git reference only detects uncommitted changes in the working tree. After committing, the working tree is clean, so the command finds zero files and exits as a no-op - making pre-push hooks ineffective.

### Solution Documented

Pre-push hooks must read stdin to get the remote SHA and pass it to `vitest --changed <base-ref>`:
- For existing branches: use the remote SHA
- For new branches: fall back to origin/main
- For deletions: skip testing
