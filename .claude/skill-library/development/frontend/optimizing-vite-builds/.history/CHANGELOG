# Changelog

## 2026-01-18 - Initial Creation

**Type**: New Skill Creation
**Category**: development/frontend
**Skill Type**: Process/Pattern

### RED Phase - Gap Documentation

**Problem**: No comprehensive Vite-specific guidance on `manualChunks` configuration patterns for preventing bundle bloat through vendor chunk splitting.

**Test Scenario**: "I need to optimize my Vite React bundle. The vendor-react chunk is 10+ MB. How do I configure manualChunks to split vendor code properly?"

**Observed Failure** (without skill):
- Agent suggested substring matching (`id.includes('react')`) which captures unintended packages
- Recommended manual dependency lists instead of pattern-based chunking
- No mention of exact path matching pattern (`/react/` vs `react`)
- Missing category-based chunking strategy validated through research
- Generic advice without real-world size targets

**Existing Skills Checked**:
- `optimizing-react-performance` - Covers route-level splitting, not Vite build config
- `avoiding-barrel-files` - Covers tree-shaking, not vendor chunking
- `using-tanstack-router/references/code-splitting.md` - Covers route patterns, not Vite manualChunks

### Content Source

Research conducted via web search (Perplexity) to gather 2025 best practices:
- Exact path matching pattern (`/react/` vs substring matching)
- Category-based vendor splitting strategy
- Real-world Chariot platform implementation validated (vendor-react: 10.5 MB → 575 KB)
- Industry sources: mykolaaleksandrov.dev, codeparrot.ai, dev.to articles

### Initial Structure

- SKILL.md: 357 lines (under 500-line target)
- Progressive disclosure: Core patterns in main file, detailed content planned for references/
- Integration section: Documents relationship with optimizing-react-performance and avoiding-barrel-files
- Decision trees: Bundle size thresholds, optimization strategy selection

### Next Steps

- Phase 6: Populate reference files with detailed patterns
- Phase 7: Add to gateway-frontend routing table
- Phase 8: GREEN verification with agent test
- Phase 9: REFACTOR pressure testing
