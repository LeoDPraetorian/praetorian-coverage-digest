## 2026-01-04 - Audit Error - Reverted Incorrect Fix

**Audit Error**: Phase 10 audit incorrectly flagged references to `designing-go-interfaces` skill as non-existent
- Skill exists at `.claude/skill-library/development/backend/designing-go-interfaces/SKILL.md`
- Initial search was flawed (searched for directories only, not SKILL.md frontmatter)
- Incorrectly removed valid cross-references at lines 109, 158, 282

**Revert Applied**: Restored original file from backup `.local/2026-01-04-17-57-49-pre-fix.bak`

**Lesson**: When Phase 10 flags missing skill references, must search both:
1. Directory names: `find .claude -type d -name "*skill-name*"`
2. SKILL.md frontmatter: `find .claude -type f -name "SKILL.md" -exec grep -l "^name: skill-name" {} \;`

**Current Status**: Skill passes Phase 10 - all references to `designing-go-interfaces` are valid

## 2026-01-01 - Cross-Reference to designing-go-interfaces Skill

**RED Phase (Gap Identified)**:
- Problem: Skill provided interface design guidance but lacked cross-reference to comprehensive `designing-go-interfaces` skill
- Without guidance: Developers might miss Dave Cheney's "accept interfaces, return structs" principle, small interface composition patterns, and detailed fat interface warnings
- Gap: Need explicit pointers to the interface design skill for comprehensive guidance

**GREEN Phase (Implementation)**:
- Updated "Interface Design" section (lines 97-116) with cross-reference to `designing-go-interfaces` skill
- Added "Key principle from that skill" subsection explaining "accept interfaces, return structs" for capability libraries
- Added "Mistake 4: Fat Interfaces" to "Common Mistakes" section with before/after examples
- Updated "HTTP Client Standards" section with reference to `designing-go-interfaces` for generic interface design principles

**Changes**:
1. Interface Design section now includes:
   - Link to `designing-go-interfaces` skill
   - "Accept interfaces, return structs" principle with 3 bullet points
   - Still references original interface-design.md reference file
2. Common Mistakes section now includes:
   - Mistake 4: Fat Interfaces with detailed guidance
   - Code examples showing wrong (10+ methods) vs correct (composed small interfaces)
   - Guidance from designing-go-interfaces: 1-3 methods ideal, 5 max
3. HTTP Client Standards section includes reference to designing-go-interfaces

**Impact**: Line count increased from 286 to ~335 lines (still under 500-line hard limit)

## 2025-12-30 - HTTP Client Standards Section Added

**RED Phase (Gap Identified)**:
- Problem: As Go capability projects scale (Venator 25+, Chariot backend 66+ HTTP-using files), developers lack standardized HTTP client patterns
- Without guidance: Developers add external libraries (go-resty, retryablehttp), create per-capability HTTP clients, leading to dependency sprawl and inconsistent error handling
- Gap: Skill covered file organization, interfaces, registry patterns, but no HTTP client standardization

**GREEN Phase (Implementation)**:
- Added "HTTP Client Standards" section after "Naming Conventions"
- Documents stdlib `net/http` + thin wrapper pattern with functional options
- References two canonical implementations: Chariot backend (`modules/chariot/backend/pkg/lib/web/http.go`) and Venator (`venator/pkg/lib/http/client.go`)
- Includes requirements checklist (6 items)
- Provides testing pattern with `net/http/httptest` example
- Full example usage showing capability integration

**Rationale**:
- HTTP client usage IS an architectural concern (dependency management, consistency)
- Pattern applies to ALL Go capability projects (Chariot, Venator, future projects)
- Keeps skill as single source of truth for "how to build capabilities correctly"

**Impact**: Line count increased from 168 to ~262 lines (still under 500-line hard limit)

## 2025-12-29 - Initial Creation

**RED Phase (Gap Proven)**:
- Problem: Porting garak (Python LLM scanner with 331 capabilities) to Go requires understanding Go-idiomatic capability architecture
- Without this skill: Developers apply Python organizational patterns that don't translate to Go
- Failure documented: Initial approach lacked understanding of complexity-based tiers, consumer-side interfaces, init() self-registration, and go:embed security patterns

**Category**: development/go-porting (Library skill)

**Skill Type**: Process/Pattern

**Research Completed**:
- HashiCorp go-plugin (RPC-based plugin system)
- ProjectDiscovery tools (Nuclei, subfinder, httpx) architecture
- Go interface segregation principle (small interfaces)
- Go project layout conventions (directories = packages)
- Registry + factory patterns with init() self-registration
- go:embed for bundling prompts/templates/data
- Go testing patterns (table-driven, interface mocking)

**Structure Created**:
- 423-line SKILL.md (under 500-line limit)
- code-structure-standards.md reference file
- Complexity-based tiers (1-4) with thresholds
- Decision trees for organization choices
- Migration strategies between tiers

**Key Patterns Documented**:
- Interface design: Small (1-3 methods), consumer-side definition, composition
- Registry: Global registry, self-registration via init(), List/Get/Register
- File organization: One file per capability, base.go for interfaces, registry.go
- Embedded resources: go:embed patterns, security considerations
- Testing: Table-driven tests, interface mocking, co-located tests

**Gold Standard Reference**: Venator structure (garak port) with 331 capabilities

**Next Steps**: GREEN phase verification and REFACTOR phase pressure testing
