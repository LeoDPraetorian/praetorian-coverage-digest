# Changelog - hypercube-deployer

## 2026-01-08 - Content Extraction (Audit Fix)

### Changed
- **Reduced line count from 287 to 253 lines** (-34 lines, 12% reduction toward 130-180 target)
- Centralized Firebase manual steps in `firebase-cli-deployment` skill (avoiding duplication)
- Extracted engagement-specific content to agent references

### Added
- **firebase-cli-deployment skill enhancement**:
  - New section: "Realtime Database Manual Creation"
  - Documents manual Console steps for first database instance creation
  - Complements existing Anonymous Authentication manual setup section

- **references/engagement-isolation-rules.md** (new):
  - OpSec-friendly Firebase project naming conventions
  - Authorization verification checklist
  - Post-engagement cleanup procedures

- **references/build-prerequisites.md** (new):
  - Go version requirements (1.16+, recommended 1.24+)
  - Firebase CLI authentication verification
  - Directory write access checks
  - Environment verification commands

### Rationale
- **Phase 8 audit finding**: Development agents should be 130-180 lines (was 287, 60% over)
- **Centralization**: Firebase-specific knowledge belongs in firebase-cli-deployment skill (single source of truth)
- **Progressive disclosure**: Detailed rules/prerequisites moved to references, agent remains focused on orchestration
- **Maintainability**: Engagement rules and prerequisites can be updated in references without touching agent core

### Audit Results
- Phase 8 (Line Count): ⚠️ WARNING (287 lines) → ⚠️ WARNING (253 lines) - Progress made, still above target
- Target: 130-180 lines for development agents
- Current: 253 lines (73 lines over max target)
- Next steps: Consider additional extractions or refactoring if further reduction needed
