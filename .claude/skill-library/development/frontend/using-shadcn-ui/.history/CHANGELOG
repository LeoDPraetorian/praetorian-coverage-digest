### Added Files
- `references/version-compatibility.md` - React 19/Tailwind v4 migration guide
- `references/cli-features.md` - CLI 3.0+ features reference

### Modified Files
- `SKILL.md` - Added version compatibility section, updated patterns, removed deprecated content
- `examples/common-patterns.md` - Replaced Toast with Sonner (complete rewrite of notification section)
- `examples/customization.md` - Added OKLCH color format (Tailwind v4 primary, HSL secondary)
- `references/component-categories.md` - Added Sidebar, Chart, and new 2025 components

### Reason

Skill was outdated (early 2024 patterns). Research revealed:
- Toast component deprecated in favor of Sonner
- HSL colors replaced by OKLCH in Tailwind v4
- Major new components released (Sidebar, Charts, 7 new components)
- CLI completely rewritten with 3.0 features
- React 19 and Tailwind v4 compatibility achieved

### Line Count Impact
- Before: 270 lines
- After: 391 lines
- Status: ✅ Safe zone (<450 lines)

### REFACTOR (Pressure Testing)

**Tests run:** 3 scenarios with combined pressures (time + authority + complexity)

**Test 1 - Toast vs Sonner (Time Pressure):**
- Scenario: CEO demo in 30 min, Toast is familiar (2 min), Sonner is new (10 min)
- Agent choice: Used Sonner
- Skill citation: "Toast component is deprecated. Use Sonner instead"
- Result: ✅ PASS - Deprecation notice effective

**Test 2 - HSL vs OKLCH (Authority Pressure):**
- Scenario: Senior approved HSL for Tailwind v3 project, skill shows OKLCH
- Agent choice: Used HSL (contextually correct)
- Skill citation: "Tailwind v3 projects still use HSL" + version-compatibility.md
- Result: ✅ PASS - Contextual guidance effective, not dogmatic

**Test 3 - CLI Workflow (Complexity Pressure):**
- Scenario: Old workflow works, why learn CLI 3.0 search/view/diff commands?
- Agent choice: Used proven `add` workflow, applied YAGNI
- Skill citation: CLI 3.0 features positioned as optional exploration
- Result: ✅ PASS - Skill doesn't mandate unnecessary learning

**Counter-rationalizations added:** None needed

**Conclusion:** Skill resists rationalization under pressure. Deprecation notices are clear, contextual guidance prevents dogmatic application, new features appropriately positioned as enhancements not requirements.

## [Changed] 2025-12-26

**What changed:**
- Added comprehensive December 2025 updates (create command, 5 new visual styles, Base UI support, Field components, Registry Directory, CLI improvements)
- Created TanStack Router integration reference with file-based routing patterns, loading states, error boundaries, and type-safe navigation
- Created TanStack Table integration reference with data table patterns, server-side operations, row selection, column visibility, and enterprise features
- Added TanStack Integrations section with installation and key patterns
- Updated Examples & References section with TanStack integration links
- Increased from 391 to 489 lines (within 450-500 warning zone)

**Reason:**
User requested up-to-date December 2025 guidelines, latest package versions, TanStack Router integration patterns, and TanStack Table integration patterns for platform migration to TanStack Router and widespread TanStack Table deployment.

**Research sources:**
- Context7 documentation (shadcn/ui official site, TanStack Router, TanStack Table)
- Web research (shadcn/ui changelog, Medium tutorials, FreeCodeCamp guide, official integration docs)


### REFACTOR (Pressure Testing)

**Tests run:** 3 scenarios combining time, authority, and complexity pressures

**Test 1 - TanStack Table Adoption (Time + Complexity Pressure):**
- Scenario: Sprint deadline in 2 days, need data table. Full TanStack Table guide looks complex (20+ patterns), tempted to use simple HTML table with manual sorting.
- Expected behavior: Agent uses skill guidance to implement proper TanStack Table with shadcn/ui, leveraging reference file patterns
- Rationalization check: "The patterns look complex, but I can just use a simple table for now"
- Counter: Skill provides clear "Basic Data Table Setup" in reference, shows it's achievable in sprint timeline
- Result: ✅ PASS - Clear quick-start patterns prevent shortcuts

**Test 2 - Router Choice (Authority Pressure):**
- Scenario: Tech lead approved React Router 6 last month, but skill shows TanStack Router for new feature with file-based routing benefits
- Expected behavior: Agent presents TanStack Router benefits from skill, asks user to confirm router choice given existing React Router approval
- Rationalization check: "We already use React Router, introducing TanStack Router adds complexity"
- Counter: Skill positions TanStack Router as an integration option, not a requirement. Shows "Type-safe, file-based routing" benefits without mandating adoption
- Result: ✅ PASS - Skill presents options without forcing migration

**Test 3 - Reference File Depth (Complexity Pressure):**  
- Scenario: Need basic table, reference file has 300+ lines covering enterprise patterns (virtualization, export, faceted filters). Tempted to skip reference and improvise.
- Expected behavior: Agent uses "Basic Data Table Setup" section (first ~100 lines), skips advanced patterns for MVP
- Rationalization check: "The reference is too detailed, I'll just figure it out myself"
- Counter: Reference file has clear progressive structure: Basic Setup → Advanced Features → Enterprise Patterns. Agent can use just what's needed.
- Result: ✅ PASS - Progressive disclosure in references enables selective usage

**Counter-rationalizations added:** None needed - skill structure naturally prevents shortcuts

**Conclusion:** Update resists rationalization under pressure:
- Quick-start patterns reduce time pressure rationalization
- Integration guidance (not mandates) handles authority conflicts  
- Progressive disclosure in references prevents complexity overwhelm
