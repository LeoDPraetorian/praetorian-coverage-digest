## [2026-01-15] - Compliance Fixes

### Fixed - Phase 3 (Line Count)

**Method**: Claude-Automated extraction
**Issue**: 586 lines exceeded 500 line hard limit
**Resolution**: Extracted detailed procedures to references/
- Created `references/phase-26-procedure.md` (Phase 26 research-based stub population)
- Created `references/phase-28-procedure.md` (Phase 28 Integration section generation)
- Created `references/common-scenarios.md` (Common fix scenarios)
- Updated SKILL.md to reference detailed procedures
**Result**: Reduced to 434 lines (26% reduction)

### Fixed - Phase 28 (Integration Section)

**Method**: Claude-Automated generation
**Issue**: Missing Integration section (had Related Skills but no structured Integration)
**Resolution**: Generated Integration section from skill analysis
- Called By: managing-skills, /skill-manager, creating-skills, updating-skills
- Requires: auditing-skills (Step 1 - identify issues)
- Calls: auditing-skills (Step 1, 5), orchestrating-research (Phase 26)
- Pairs With: syncing-gateways (Phase 23 coverage gaps)
**Result**: Integration section inserted before Related Skills

### Fixed - Description Quality (Semantic)

**Method**: Claude-Automated enhancement
**Issue**: Missing key capability mentions in description
**Resolution**: Enhanced description from 107 to 219 characters
- Added: "three-tier fix orchestration (deterministic/hybrid/Claude-automated)"
- Added: "Phase 26 research-based stub population"
- Added: "Phase 28 Integration section generation"
- Added: "line count extraction"
**Result**: Improved discoverability and completeness
