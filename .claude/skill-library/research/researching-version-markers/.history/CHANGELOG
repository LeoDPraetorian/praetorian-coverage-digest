# Changelog: researching-version-markers

## 2025-12-30 - Initial Creation

**Author:** Claude AI (via skill-manager create)

**Category:** library-development-capabilities

**Skill Type:** process/pattern

**RED Phase Documentation:**

**Gap identified:** The fingerprintx development workflow had a methodology for protocol detection (`researching-protocols`) but lacked a systematic approach for version-specific marker research. This left developers without guidance for building precise version fingerprint matrices that enable CPE generation like `cpe:2.3:a:oracle:mysql:8.0.23` instead of generic `mysql:*`.

**Failure scenario:** When building fingerprintx modules for open-source services:
1. Developer uses `researching-protocols` for protocol detection
2. Wants version-granular detection (8.0.23 vs 8.0.4 vs 5.7.x)
3. NO SKILL EXISTS for researching version-specific markers systematically
4. Developer either skips version detection or does ad-hoc research
5. Result: Imprecise CPEs, missed version boundaries, unreliable enrichment phase

**Test confirmed:** No existing skill for version marker research in fingerprintx workflow.

**Initial implementation:**
- 8-phase workflow (Repository Setup → Validation)
- Integration with `researching-github` for source analysis
- Marker categorization (6 categories: Capability Flags, Default Configs, New Features, Error Formats, Banner Strings, Protocol Extensions)
- Version Fingerprint Matrix as primary deliverable
- 4 reference documents created
- Positioned between `researching-protocols` and `writing-fingerprintx-modules` in workflow

**Gateway placement:** `.claude/skills/gateway-capabilities` - FINGERPRINTX DEVELOPMENT section (optional, for open-source protocols)

**Line count:** 357 lines (SKILL.md) - well under 500-line limit

**References created:**
1. `release-enumeration-patterns.md` - gh CLI commands for GitHub, GitLab
2. `marker-categories.md` - Deep dive on 6 marker types with confidence ratings
3. `version-matrix-template.md` - Copy-paste template for output
4. `common-protocol-handlers.md` - Where to find protocol code by language

**Related skills:**
- `researching-protocols` (prerequisite) - Protocol detection research
- `writing-fingerprintx-modules` (consumer) - Implements enrichment phase using matrix
- `researching-github` (invoked) - Repository discovery and source analysis

**Key innovation:** Shifts from black-box probing to white-box source analysis for open-source protocols, enabling version-granular detection through systematic cross-version diff analysis.
