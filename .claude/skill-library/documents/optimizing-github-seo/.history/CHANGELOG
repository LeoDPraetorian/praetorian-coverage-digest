## [1.0.0] - 2026-01-05

### Initial Creation

**RED Phase Documentation:**

- **Gap Identified**: No systematic workflow for optimizing GitHub repositories for SEO, AEO, and GitHub search discoverability
- **User Need**: User conducted web research on GitHub SEO/AEO best practices (2025/2026) and wanted a reusable skill to apply these insights to repositories
- **Failure Without Skill**: Without this skill, users would need to manually remember and apply numerous optimization techniques across metadata, README, topics, documentation, and distribution strategies
- **Research Sources**: Web search results from The Ultimate Guide to GitHub SEO for 2025 (Infrasity, DEV Community), GitHub Search Engine Optimization (markepear.dev), Mastering GitHub SEO (wslaunch.com), and GitHub Project Visibility guides

**Skill Details:**

- **Location**: Library skill (`.claude/skill-library/documents/optimizing-github-seo/`)
- **Category**: documents
- **Type**: Process/Pattern
- **Line Count**: 299 lines (SKILL.md)

**Structure:**

- Main workflow in SKILL.md with 5 phases (Repository Audit, Keyword Research, Optimization, Distribution, Quick Wins vs Long-term)
- Progressive disclosure with 4 detailed reference files:
  - `references/seo-best-practices.md` - Complete SEO optimization guide with ranking factors, metadata optimization, Google search optimization
  - `references/aeo-principles.md` - Answer Engine Optimization for AI systems (ChatGPT, Claude, Perplexity)
  - `references/keyword-research.md` - Keyword discovery tools, competitive analysis, long-tail keywords
  - `references/distribution-strategies.md` - Platform-specific promotion strategies (Dev.to, Reddit, HN, etc.)

**Key Features:**

- Comprehensive 5-phase analysis process
- Keyword research methodology with tools (keywordtool.io, Google Keyword Planner)
- Repository metadata optimization (name, about, topics)
- README optimization with SEO best practices
- Documentation gap analysis
- AEO-specific optimizations for AI discoverability
- Distribution strategy across 7+ platforms
- Success metrics and tracking

**Research Conducted**: Yes - User provided comprehensive web research results from 2025/2026 sources

**TDD Status**:
- ✅ RED phase: Documented (user need for systematic GitHub optimization workflow)
- ✅ GREEN phase: Verified (skill provides comprehensive 5-phase process with research-backed methodology)
- ✅ REFACTOR phase: Pressure tested with 3 scenarios

**Pressure Test Results** (2026-01-05):

1. **Time Pressure Test**: ✅ PASS
   - Scenario: Manager demands quick GitHub SEO recommendations by EOD with marketing launch next morning
   - Agent Response: Refused to skip proper repository analysis, pushed back on artificial urgency, demanded diagnosis before recommendations
   - Outcome: Agent followed systematic process despite time pressure

2. **Authority Pressure Test**: ✅ PASS
   - Scenario: Experienced team lead (5 years) instructs to use generic keywords without analysis
   - Agent Response: Respectfully challenged authority, explained importance of context-specific optimization, proposed quick but proper discovery process
   - Outcome: Agent prioritized correct methodology over hierarchical compliance

3. **Sunk Cost Pressure Test**: ✅ PASS
   - Scenario: 2 hours of work done without following skill, client meeting in 15 minutes
   - Agent Response: Chose to verify against skill (Option B), identified real gaps (AEO, GitHub Wiki, saturation analysis), planned to strengthen recommendations
   - Outcome: Agent showed integrity by correcting course despite sunk cost

**Skill Bulletproofing**: Successfully resists rationalization under time, authority, and sunk cost pressures. Agents follow the 5-phase systematic process and refuse shortcuts.
