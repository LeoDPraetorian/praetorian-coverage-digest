## 2025-12-30 - Add phased plan execution support

**Type:** Enhancement (Progressive disclosure for plan execution)

**Problem:**
The executing-plans skill assumes single plan files. writing-plans now produces phased plans (directory with PLAN.md manifest + phase-N-name.md files) for large features (>30 tasks, >5 components). executing-plans had no ability to handle phased plans, causing execution failures.

**Gap:**
- No plan type detection (single file vs directory)
- No PLAN.md manifest parsing
- No phase-level progress tracking
- No entry/exit criteria verification
- No phase-by-phase execution workflow

**Solution:**
Added complete phased plan execution support:

1. **Plan Type Detection** (line 19-37):
   - Detects single-file vs phased directory
   - Links to phased workflow section

2. **Phased Plan Workflow** (line 114-303):
   - Step 1: Load PLAN.md manifest
   - Step 2: Identify current phase from progress tracking
   - Step 3: Load current phase file
   - Step 4: Verify entry criteria (prerequisites)
   - Step 5: Execute phase tasks in batches (existing batch logic)
   - Step 6: Verify exit criteria (definition of done)
   - Step 7: Update PLAN.md progress (mark phase complete)
   - Step 8: Report phase completion
   - Step 9: Continue to next phase
   - Step 10: Complete development (all phases done)

3. **Phased Plan Key Differences** (line 306-316):
   - Comparison table: single-file vs phased plan workflows
   - Progress tracking at phase level
   - Manifest updates after each phase

4. **Phase Dependencies** (line 320-333):
   - Sequential phases (must complete in order)
   - Parallel opportunities (independent phases)
   - Dependency graph checking

5. **Troubleshooting** (line 337-353):
   - Entry criteria not met
   - Exit criteria failing
   - Can't find phase file
   - Lost track of progress

6. **Reference** (line 357-369):
   - Links to writing-plans/references/plan-decomposition.md
   - Complete phase structure details

**Impact:**
- executing-plans now handles both single-file and phased plans
- Phase-by-phase execution with entry/exit criteria verification
- Progress tracking in PLAN.md manifest
- Natural resume points between phases
- Prevents context overflow for large plans

**File Changes:**
- SKILL.md: Added 282 lines (88 → 370 lines, under 500 limit)
- Created .local/ directory for backups
- Created .history/ directory for changelog
- Added TodoWrite mandate (CRITICAL fix)
- Updated allowed-tools (added Write, Edit, TodoWrite)
- Updated description to mention phased plan support

**Testing:**
- ✅ Plan Type Detection section present (line 19)
- ✅ Phased Plan Workflow section complete (line 114-303)
- ✅ Links to plan-decomposition.md reference
- ✅ Line count under 500 (370 total)
- ✅ TodoWrite mandate added
- ✅ All 10 phased workflow steps documented
