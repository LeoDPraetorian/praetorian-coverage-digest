### Created
- Initial agent creation with 10-phase TDD workflow
- Type: analysis

### RED Phase Evidence
- Gap: Threat modeling orchestrator spawns codebase-mapper agents with hardcoded paths, without knowing component sizes or optimal strategy
- Failure: No sizing assessment phase exists between Phase 0 (Business Context) and Phase 1 (Codebase Mapping)

### Validation
- GREEN: Pending
