# Changelog - integrating-with-azuredevops

## 2026-01-06 - Initial Creation

**Type:** New Skill
**Category:** development/integrations
**Skill Type:** Integration
**Author:** Claude Code (Sonnet 4.5)

### RED Phase Documentation

**Gap Identified:** No dedicated skill for Azure DevOps integration, while similar skills exist for GitHub, BitBucket, and GitLab.

**Test Scenario:** Developer asks "help me integrate Azure DevOps repositories with Chariot"

**Failure Without Skill:**
- Would rely on generic REST API integration knowledge
- Would search scattered Azure DevOps code examples in codebase
- Might miss Azure DevOps-specific patterns (PAT scopes, API versioning, WIQL queries)
- No structured reference for webhooks, PR automation, or pipeline integration
- No guidance on work item tracking integration

**Expected With Skill:**
- Immediate access to Azure DevOps-specific patterns and authentication methods
- Structured guidance on repos, pipelines, work items, and webhooks
- Reference documentation for common integration scenarios
- Error handling and rate limiting strategies specific to Azure DevOps

### Initial Implementation

**Structure:**
- SKILL.md: 490 lines (within 450-500 warning threshold)
- Location: `.claude/skill-library/development/integrations/`
- Progressive disclosure: Main patterns in SKILL.md, detailed content in references/

**Coverage:**
- Authentication (PAT, OAuth, Service Principal)
- Repository discovery and asset mapping
- Pull request automation
- Pipeline integration and security monitoring
- Work item tracking with WIQL queries
- Webhook configuration for git, build, and work item events
- Error handling and rate limiting
- Integration patterns and testing guidance
