## [Initial Creation] - 2026-01-14

### Added
- Initial skill creation following TDD workflow
- Four core coordination patterns:
  - Pattern 1: State-Based Guards
  - Pattern 2: Event-Based Sequencing
  - Pattern 3: Priority Queuing
  - Pattern 4: Mutex/Lock Pattern
- Common interference patterns table
- Debugging workflow (4-step process)
- Real-world example from Graph Explorer (useViewportCulling interference)
- Quick decision tree for pattern selection
- Integration section with skill dependencies

### Context
- **Category**: frontend (library skill)
- **Skill Type**: Process/Pattern
- **Location**: .claude/skill-library/frontend/coordinating-competing-systems/

### RED Phase Documentation
- **Problem**: Complex UIs have multiple async systems that interfere (layout vs culling, animation vs interaction, loading vs display, async state races)
- **Failure Mode**: Features work in isolation but break when combined, leading to developers disabling entire systems
- **Specific Example**: useViewportCulling.ts disabled in Graph Explorer with comment "interfering with layout" because FA2Layout needs all nodes visible
- **Current Workaround**: Developers disable features entirely or add TODO comments without understanding root cause
- **Gap**: No systematic patterns for coordinating competing systems, no guard conditions, no sequencing strategies

### Line Count
- SKILL.md: 295 lines (safe, well under 500-line limit)
- Progressive disclosure: Core patterns in main file, detailed implementations in references/
