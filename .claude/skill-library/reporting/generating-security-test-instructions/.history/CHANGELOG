# Changelog

## 2026-01-16 - Initial Creation

**Type:** New skill creation via TDD methodology

**Category:** Library skill - reporting

**Skill Type:** Process/Pattern (methodology for generating test case documentation)

**Location:** `.claude/skill-library/reporting/generating-security-test-instructions/`

### RED Phase Documentation

**Problem Statement:**
Creating comprehensive security test case instructions requires manual back-and-forth conversation with no systematic scoping questions, no reusable structure, and inconsistent output quality.

**Test Scenario:**
Generate testing instructions for 3 API security test cases without any skill guidance.

**Observed Failure (Agent Task Output):**
- Agent created 132KB of documentation without asking scoping questions
- Assumed tools (JWT, Go backend patterns) from CLAUDE.md instead of asking user
- No structured intake process (accepted freeform test case list)
- Created verbose output (132KB) when user's original request suggested more focused documentation
- Made assumptions about timeframe, severity thresholds, and output format
- No verification of tool availability or assessment constraints

**Specific Gaps Identified:**
1. No systematic scoping questions (tools, timeframe, assessment type, format preferences)
2. No structured test case input template
3. Assumptions instead of explicit questions
4. Output detail level not calibrated to assessment duration
5. No reusability - every request requires full regeneration

### GREEN Target

Skill that:
- Uses AskUserQuestion for systematic scoping (Phase 2)
- Asks about tools available (Burp, Postman, curl)
- Asks about timeframe (1-2 days, 3-5 days, 1+ week)
- Asks about assessment type (pentest, audit, compliance)
- Asks about output format preferences
- Generates practitioner-focused markdown files calibrated to timeframe
- Includes finding templates with severity guidelines
- Creates master README with workflow guidance
- Outputs to `.claude/.output/{project-name}-testing/`

### Changes

**Files Created:**
- `SKILL.md` (433 lines) - Main skill workflow
- `.history/CHANGELOG` (this file)

**Directory Structure:**
```
.claude/skill-library/reporting/generating-security-test-instructions/
├── SKILL.md
├── .history/
│   └── CHANGELOG
├── references/  (to be populated in Phase 6)
└── examples/    (to be populated in Phase 6)
```

**Progressive Disclosure:**
- Moved template library to references/template-selection.md
- Moved README structure to references/readme-structure.md
- Moved anti-patterns to references/anti-patterns.md
- Kept core workflow in SKILL.md (<500 lines)

**Next Steps:**
- Phase 6: Research & populate references/
- Phase 7: Update gateway-reporting (if exists)
- Phase 8: GREEN verification with agent spawn
- Phase 9: REFACTOR pressure testing

## 2026-01-16 - GREEN Phase Verification

**Phase 8 Complete:** Skill successfully verified via agent spawn.

### RED vs GREEN Comparison

**RED (Without Skill):**
- No scoping questions asked
- Assumed tools from CLAUDE.md  
- Created 132KB documentation
- Made environment assumptions

**GREEN (With Skill):**
- ✅ Asked 5 systematic scoping questions
- ✅ Tool commands matched user's actual tools (Burp Community + curl)
- ✅ Detail level matched timeframe (1-2 days = concise, 1,782 lines)
- ✅ Format matched preferences (simple markdown)
- ✅ No automation scripts (timeframe criterion not met)

**Gap Status:** CLOSED

### Compliance Audit

- Line count: 433 (✅ < 500)
