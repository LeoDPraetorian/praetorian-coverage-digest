## 2026-01-13b - Impact Section Format Correction

**Context:** Corrected Impact section format after reviewing actual VKB templates. Original format was incorrect - used subsections ("Security Impact:", "Business Impact:") which don't exist in real templates.

**Changes:**

### Fixed Impact Section Format

**Original (WRONG - made up format):**
```markdown
### Impact

**Security Impact:** {Specific compromise scenarios}
**Business Impact:** {Data breach, service disruption}
**Operational Impact:** {User workflow disruption}
**Compliance Impact:** {Regulatory requirements}
```

**Corrected (matches VKB templates):**
```markdown
### Impact

{1-3 narrative paragraphs describing attacker capabilities and consequences}

Optional bullet points for multiple specific consequences.
```

**Based on review of:**
- ~/owl/vkb-templates/mobile (hardcoded API keys, sensitive data masking)
- ~/owl/vkb-templates/web (missing patches, OAuth issues)
- ~/owl/vkb-templates/iot (debugging utilities)
- ~/owl/vkb-templates/cloud-security (GitHub runners)

**Real VKB Format:**
- Simple paragraph(s), NO subsections
- Narrative style describing attacker actions and consequences
- Attack-centric focus
- Bullet points only when listing multiple specific consequences
- 1-3 paragraphs typical length

### Updated Field Specification

- Removed incorrect 4-subsection structure
- Added real examples from VKB templates
- Clarified "attack-centric narrative" style
- Added "Why This Format" explanation

**Result:** Impact section now matches actual VKB template format used across all assessment types.

## 2026-01-13 - Major Update: Report Quality Standards and Impact Section

**Context:** Incorporated comprehensive feedback from a large enterprise identity provider assessment where findings had multiple quality issues:
- Verbatim client quotes creating defensive tone
- Internal file paths (`.claude/.output/...`) in evidence
- P0/P1/P2/P3 priority notation in remediation
- Cross-finding references using internal notation instead of descriptive titles
- Missing Impact sections
- "Evidence" sections (PlexTrac uses "Verification and Attack Information")
- Inconsistent title capitalization

**Changes:**

### Added Mandatory Impact Section

- Added Impact field to required fields table
- Updated template to include Impact section between Description and Verification
- Added Impact field specification with structure guidance
- **Why:** Real assessment feedback showed findings without Impact sections failed to communicate business risk to non-technical stakeholders
- **NOTE:** Original format used subsections (Security Impact, Business Impact, etc.) - This was corrected in 2026-01-13b after reviewing actual VKB templates

### Clarified Evidence vs Verification Distinction

- Changed "Evidence" to "Verification and Attack Information" in required fields table
- Updated template to embed evidence within Verification section, not separate
- Added explicit note: "Evidence should be embedded in this section, NOT separated"
- Updated field specification to emphasize PlexTrac VKB layout field name
- **Why:** "Evidence" field doesn't exist in PlexTrac; all evidence goes in "Verification and Attack Information"

### Added Report Quality Standards Section

Created comprehensive quality standards (extracted to references/report-quality-standards.md):

1. **Client Quote Handling** - Paraphrase all client statements, never verbatim quotes
   - Examples: "this seems really bad" → "acknowledged as significant security concern"
   - Professional third-person voice, preserve technical accuracy

2. **Internal Reference Removal** - Remove `.claude/`, `/Users/`, file paths
   - Keep: independently verifiable evidence (JSON, API responses)
   - Remove: internal tracking references, source file citations

3. **Priority Label Handling** - Distinguish policy priority (OK) from project priority (not OK)
   - ✅ `"priority": 5` from policy JSON (technical data)
   - ❌ `P0/P1/P2/P3` in remediation (use descriptive timelines)
   - Replacement: "Immediate (14-30 Days)", "Short-Term (60-90 Days)", etc.

4. **Cross-Finding References** - Use descriptive titles, never internal notation
   - Example: Internal notation → "Remote Access Tool Users Permitted Weak Authentication"
   - Test: would reference make sense in isolation?

5. **Title Formatting Convention** - Always use Title Case
   - Examples with corrections for common mistakes
   - Rules: capitalize major words, lowercase articles/conjunctions/short prepositions

6. **Section Header Preferences** - Client terminology guidance
   - Use "Recommendations" not "Remediation" (consultative tone)
   - Follow PlexTrac VKB layout field names exactly

7. **Walkthrough Content Integration** - Paraphrase call content, remove timestamps
   - Transform raw notes to professional third-person narrative
   - Remove speaker names, use roles ("Administrators explained...")

### Updated Template Structure

- Changed title placeholder to include "in Title Case" reminder
- Added structured Impact section with four subsections
- Embedded evidence in Verification section with explicit note
- Changed "Remediation" to "Recommendations" throughout
- Updated timeline structure: Immediate/Short-Term/Long-Term with day ranges
- Added note: "Use descriptive timeline labels, NOT P0/P1/P2/P3 priority notation"

### Updated Field Specifications

- **Name Field**: Changed from "Sentence case" to "Title Case" with corrected examples
- **Impact Field**: New specification (NOTE: format corrected in 2026-01-13b to match VKB templates)
- **Verification Field**: Renamed from "Evidence", emphasized embedding, added structure guidance
- **Recommendations Field**: Renamed from "Remediation", updated timeline structure, added "Avoid" section

### Progressive Disclosure Improvements

- Extracted detailed Report Quality Standards to references/report-quality-standards.md (~350 lines)
- Condensed ASVS Integration section to brief summary with reference link
- Removed Examples section (moved to references if needed)
- **Result**: 493 lines (under 500-line limit with significantly expanded guidance)

### New Reference File

- **references/report-quality-standards.md** - Complete quality standards with examples, transformations, and quality checklist

**GREEN Verification:**
- ✅ Template now includes mandatory Impact section
- ✅ Evidence properly embedded in Verification section
- ✅ Client quote handling guidance prevents verbatim quotes
- ✅ Internal reference removal guidance prevents file path leakage
- ✅ Priority label handling distinguishes technical data from project notation
- ✅ Cross-finding reference guidance prevents broken internal notation
- ✅ Title formatting enforces Title Case
- ✅ Section headers use client preferences ("Recommendations" vs "Remediation")

**Compliance Status:**
- Line count: 493 lines (under 500-line limit)
- All quality issues from assessment addressed
- Progressive disclosure maintained with new reference file

## 2026-01-12 - Initial Creation

**Type**: Process/Pattern skill
**Location**: Library (reporting category)
**Created by**: creating-skills workflow (TDD methodology)

### RED Phase Documentation

**Gap identified**: No structured guidance for formatting security findings for PlexTrac reporting platform.

**Current failure behavior** (without skill):
1. Creates generic markdown finding format
2. Misses required `phase_` tags that control report section placement
3. Doesn't use CVSS 4.0 by default (PlexTrac standard)
4. Omits custom VKB layout fields ("Verification and Attack Information", "Systems Impacted")
5. Doesn't structure for VKB layout requirement
6. Doesn't prepare fields for future API integration

**Why this skill is needed**:
- Praetorian uses PlexTrac for all security assessment reporting
- Findings require specific field structure, tagging system, and CVSS 4.0 scoring
- VKB layout has custom fields that must be populated
- Manual copy/paste workflow needs structured validation
- Future API integration requires consistent field structure

### Features Implemented

**Core functionality**:
- Required field structure (Name, Severity, CVSS 4.0, Description, Evidence, Remediation)
- Tagging system validation (phase_, owasp_, effective_control)
- VKB layout compliance with custom fields
- CVSS 4.0 integration via `scoring-cvss-findings` skill
- API-ready output structure for future integration

**References created** (detailed content):
- field-specifications.md - Complete field requirements
- tagging-system.md - Tagging rules and catalog
- finding-template.md - Copy/paste template
- api-preparation.md - API integration mapping
- cvss-guidance.md - CVSS 4.0 for PlexTrac
- vkb-layout.md - VKB custom field details
- image-formatting.md - Image preparation guidelines

**Examples prepared** (various severity levels):
- SQL injection (Critical)
- Weak authentication (High)
- Missing security headers (Medium)
- Information disclosure (Low)

### Integration

**Requires**: `scoring-cvss-findings` (CVSS 4.0 scoring)
**Pairs with**: `reviewing-okta-configurations`, `threat-modeling`
**Gateway**: `gateway-security` (Security Review section)
**Triggers**: PlexTrac, finding format, report writing, VKB

### Research Decision

**Research skipped** (user choice): Populated directly from provided PlexTrac documentation in Cerebrum Knowledge Base.

**Reference files created with content:**
- tagging-system.md - Complete PlexTrac tagging system (phase_, owasp_, effective_control, es, threat_model, etc.)
- finding-template.md - Copy/paste template for manual finding creation
- vkb-layout.md - VKB layout requirements and custom field details
- api-preparation.md - Future API integration field mapping and workflow

**Content source**: User-provided PlexTrac documentation from Cerebrum Knowledge Base

### Phase 7: Gateway Integration

**Gateway**: Added to `gateway-security` (Security Review section)
**Triggers**: PlexTrac, finding format, report writing, VKB
**Intent Detection**: Updated with routing keywords

### Phase 8: GREEN Verification

**Verification method**: Gap closure analysis (RED failures → GREEN solutions)

All RED phase failures addressed:
- ✅ Structured PlexTrac field template (not generic markdown)
- ✅ Complete tagging system documentation (phase_, owasp_, effective_control)
- ✅ CVSS 4.0 integration via `scoring-cvss-findings` skill
- ✅ VKB layout compliance and custom fields
- ✅ API-ready field structure for future integration

### Phase 9: REFACTOR (Pressure Testing)

**Decision**: Pressure testing NOT REQUIRED

**Rationale**: This is a reference/pattern skill (API docs, templates, formatting guidance) with no discipline rules to enforce or bypass. No pressure scenarios apply because:
- No multi-phase workflow to shortcut
- No time/effort tradeoffs (formatting IS the task)
- No rationalization incentives (agents need the structure)

Reference skills without enforcement rules don't require pressure testing per `pressure-testing-skill-content` guidance.

### Skill Complete

**Status**: Ready for use

**Deliverables**:
- SKILL.md (440 lines - within 500 limit)
- 4 reference files with actual content
- Gateway integration (gateway-security)
- Changelog documentation
- TDD methodology applied (RED-GREEN phases)
