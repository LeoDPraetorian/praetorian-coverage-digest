## 2026-01-13 - Major Update: Testify Mandate + Rename to implementing-golang-tests

**Changes:**
1. Renamed from `implementing-backend-tests` to `implementing-golang-tests` for clarity
2. Added CRITICAL testify mandate section at top (NON-NEGOTIABLE)
3. Provided testify assertion examples (assert.* vs require.*)
4. Added anti-pattern examples showing t.Error vs testify
5. Scoped skill to Go only (Python tests should use separate skill)
6. Added explicit "If you write t.Error, STOP immediately" directive

**Why:**
Julius code review showed tests using `t.Error` instead of testify despite skill line 85-86 mandate. The mandate wasn't prominent enough and lacked enforcement language.

**Test scenario:**
- User creates Julius CLI tool via feature pipeline
- backend-developer implements tests
- Tests should use testify assertions throughout
- Previous: Tests used t.Error/t.Errorf
- After fix: CRITICAL block at top makes testify non-negotiable

**Line count:** 236 lines (was 198) - still under 400 line inline limit
