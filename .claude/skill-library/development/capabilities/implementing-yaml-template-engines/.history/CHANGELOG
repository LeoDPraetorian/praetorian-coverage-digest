# Changelog - implementing-yaml-template-engines

## [1.0.0] - 2026-01-04

### Initial Creation

**RED Phase Documentation:**
- **Gap Identified**: Developers lack guidance for implementing YAML-based template engines for security scanners
- **Current Failure**: Claude provides generic YAML parsing advice without Nuclei patterns, DSL evaluation, matcher/extractor engines, or Chariot integration
- **Expected Behavior**: Guide through Parser → Compiler → Executor → Matcher → Extractor architecture with DSL expressions, template caching, and Chariot integration

**Skill Metadata:**
- **Location**: Library (.claude/skill-library/development/capabilities/)
- **Category**: development/capabilities
- **Type**: Process/Pattern
- **Line Count**: 498 lines (under 500 limit)

**Architecture Covered:**
- Five core components (Parser, Compiler, Executor, Matcher, Extractor)
- Nuclei template structure (id, info, protocol, matchers, extractors)
- DSL expression evaluation with variable interpolation
- Template registry patterns with caching
- Request clustering optimization
- Integration with Tabularium Risk model and Janus framework

**Key References Prepared:**
- parser-implementation.md (validation, error handling)
- compiler-architecture.md (compilation pipeline, caching)
- dsl-evaluation.md (variable context, helper functions)
- matcher-implementation.md (condition trees, optimization)
- extractor-implementation.md (extraction logic, JSON/XML parsing)
- chariot-integration.md (Risk mapping, Janus registration)
- registry-patterns.md (concurrent access, hot-reloading)
- clustering-optimization.md (clustering algorithms, performance)
- error-handling.md (validation rules, debugging)
- performance-tuning.md (benchmarks, profiling)
- testing-patterns.md (test fixtures, coverage targets)

**Next Steps:**
- Phase 6: Research and populate reference files
- Phase 7: Add to gateway-capabilities routing table
- Phase 8: GREEN verification with audit
- Phase 9: REFACTOR pressure testing
