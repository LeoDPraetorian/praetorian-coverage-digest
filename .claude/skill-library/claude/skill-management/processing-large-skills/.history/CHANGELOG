# Changelog - processing-large-skills

## 2026-01-10 - Initial Creation

**RED Phase Documentation:**

- **Gap:** When encountering skills with progressive disclosure (SKILL.md + 5-15 reference files), Claude either:
  - Reads only SKILL.md, missing detailed patterns in references
  - Reads files sequentially, losing context between files
  - Fails to synthesize how components relate to each other
  - Cannot trace dependency chains (skill A calls skill B calls skill C)

- **Test Scenario:** "Help me understand the managing-skills skill"
  - managing-skills has SKILL.md + 7 reference files + delegates to 10 library skills
  - Without systematic analysis: partial understanding, missed relationships, incomplete dependency map

- **Failure Behaviors:**
  - Reads 2-3 files, claims understanding
  - Misses that managing-skills is a router (doesn't implement, only delegates)
  - Cannot explain the full workflow from command to library skill execution
  - No structured output for future reference

**Skill Details:**

- **Category:** claude/skill-management
- **Type:** Process/Pattern
- **Location:** Library (.claude/skill-library/)
- **Purpose:** Systematic analysis of complex, multi-file skills using parallel agent coordination
- **Modes:** understand, compare, trace

**Created:** Initial SKILL.md with 250 lines (within <500 line limit)

**GREEN Phase:** Skill successfully addresses gap - provides systematic parallel analysis

**REFACTOR Phase:**
- Pressure Test 1 (Time): PASS ✅
- Pressure Test 2 (Authority): PASS ✅
- Pressure Test 3 (Sunk Cost): FAIL ❌ → Loophole closed
- Added counter-rationalization: "User already spent time reading manually" pitfall
- Re-test after loophole closure: Counter-rationalization recognized
- Final line count: 252 lines (within <500 line limit)
