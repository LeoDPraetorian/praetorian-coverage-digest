## [2026-01-21] - Compliance Fixes from Audit

### Fixed

- **Phase 4 (Broken Links)**: Fixed 5 broken cross-skill reference links
  - Line 64: `.claude/skills/managing-skills/references/skill-compliance-contract.md` → `../../../../skills/managing-skills/references/skill-compliance-contract.md`
  - Line 82: `.claude/skills/using-skills/references/rationalization-prevention.md` → `../../../../skills/using-skills/references/rationalization-prevention.md`
  - Lines 137, 363: `.claude/skills/managing-skills/references/tdd-methodology.md` → `../../../../skills/managing-skills/references/tdd-methodology.md` (2 instances)
  - Line 472: `.claude/skills/managing-skills/references/tdd-methodology.md` → `../../../../skills/managing-skills/references/tdd-methodology.md`
  - Line 474: `.claude/skills/managing-skills/references/patterns/line-count-limits.md` → `../../../../skills/managing-skills/references/patterns/line-count-limits.md`
  - Line 475: `.claude/skills/managing-skills/references/progressive-disclosure.md` → `../../../../skills/managing-skills/references/progressive-disclosure.md`

- **Phase 5 (File Organization)**: Created `.history/CHANGELOG` to track skill evolution

- **Phase 27 (Relative Path Depth)**: Fixed cross-skill links that used `.claude/` repo-root format by converting to proper relative paths with correct depth (`../../../../skills/...`)

- **Phase 30 (Logical Coherence)**: Added clarifying note to Success Criteria item "Changelog updated" pointing to update-workflow.md Phase 5 where detailed procedure lives

### Reason

- Audit revealed broken links that prevented proper cross-skill reference resolution
- Links used `.claude/` repo-root format which doesn't resolve from skill subdirectories
- Missing changelog prevented tracking skill evolution per compliance contract

### Method

- Hybrid fix (Phase 4): Deterministic path correction with verification
- Deterministic fix (Phase 5): File creation
- Auto-fix (Phase 27): Path pattern normalization

### Impact

- All cross-skill reference links now resolve correctly
- Skill evolution history is now tracked
- Compliance with skill-compliance-contract.md achieved

### Not Fixed (By User Request)

- **Phase 3 (Line Count)**: references/update-workflow.md at 517 lines (17 over limit) - User declined file splitting
