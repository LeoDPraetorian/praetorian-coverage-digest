## [Date: 2025-12-26 - Fix CLI Command Reference]

### Changed
- **Step 4a title** - Changed from "CLI Auto-Fix" to "fixing-skills CLI" for clarity
- **Step 4a command** - Updated from `npm run audit -- {skill-name} --fix` to `npm run -w @chariot/fixing-skills fix -- {skill-name}`
- **Step 4a phases** - Updated from "2, 5, 7, 18" to "2, 4, 5, 6, 7, 10, 12" (complete deterministic list from fix.ts)

### Reason
- **RED failure**: Documentation referenced non-existent `audit --fix` command
- audit.ts doesn't have --fix flag (only --phase, --verbose, --quiet, --agents)
- fixing-skills has separate CLI: `npm run -w @chariot/fixing-skills fix`
- Command separation: audit (detect) → fix (remediate)

### Technical Details
- fix.ts lives in @chariot/fixing-skills package (separate from audit package)
- fix.ts handles deterministic phases: 2, 4, 5, 6, 7, 10, 12
- Claude-automated phases still handled by skill orchestration (no CLI for semantic fixes)

### Files Changed
- `SKILL.md` - Line 92-97 (Step 4a section)

### Method
- Used `updating-skills` TDD workflow (RED-GREEN-REFACTOR)
- Line count: 491 → 491 lines (equal replacement, no net change)
