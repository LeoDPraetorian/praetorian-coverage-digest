## 2026-01-01 - Initial Creation

**Type:** Library/Framework (GraphQL API documentation)
**Category:** Library (development/backend)
**Created by:** Claude (via /skill-manager create)

**Problem**: Implementing GraphQL clients with performance optimization (batch queries achieve 3x improvement: 1,666 → 5,000 repos/hour), rate limiting (GitHub 5,000 points/hour), and security (variable binding prevents injection).

**Content**: Batch query patterns (50-100 items/request), variable binding security, cursor pagination, rate limiting with proactive throttling (5% remaining), cost estimation, Gato-X production example, provider differences (GitHub/GitLab/Azure DevOps).

**SKILL.md**: 495 lines - Batch queries, variable binding, rate limiting, pagination, client implementation, production example (Gato-X), quick reference

**References**: rate-limiting-patterns.md, pagination-patterns.md, client-implementation.md, cost-calculation.md, production-examples.md, common-pitfalls.md, testing-patterns.md, provider-differences.md
