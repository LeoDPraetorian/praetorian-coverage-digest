## 2026-01-04 - Initial Creation

### Context
- **RED Failure**: Backend-tester agent was 201 lines (target <150), with 50+ lines of embedded test implementation workflow that should be reusable
- **Category**: testing/backend (library skill)
- **Skill Type**: Process/Pattern (methodology for implementing tests from test-lead's plan)

### Content Extracted from backend-tester.md
- Test Implementation Process (lines 130-182):
  - Step 1: Locate the Test Plan (bash examples, decision matrix)
  - Step 2: Implement Tests Following Plan (table: Plan Section → What to Follow)
  - Step 3: Verify Against Plan's Acceptance Criteria (checklist)
- Test Mode Selection table (Unit/Integration/Acceptance with tools)
- Mandatory Protocols (Behavior Over Implementation, Verify Before Test, TDD Cycle, Follow the Plan)

### Result
- Created implementing-backend-tests skill at .claude/skill-library/testing/backend/implementing-backend-tests/SKILL.md
- Skill is 198 lines (well under 500 line limit)
- Provides 3-step workflow for implementing backend tests according to test-lead's plan
- Includes test mode selection guidance and mandatory protocols
