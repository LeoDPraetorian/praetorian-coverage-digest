# Changelog

All notable changes to orchestration-prompt-patterns skill will be documented in this file.

## [1.0.0] - 2026-01-10

### Added - Initial Creation

**RED Phase Documentation:**
- **Gap**: Orchestration skills and agent prompt templates lack systematic guidance on prompt engineering patterns
- **Problem**: Inconsistent agent output quality, agents skip steps, superficial reviews, poorly calibrated confidence scores
- **Test Scenario**: Creating new orchestration workflows requires reinventing prompt patterns from scratch or copying inconsistently
- **Failure**: No centralized skill providing reusable prompt engineering patterns (few-shot, chain-of-thought, self-consistency, progressive disclosure, confidence calibration)

**Skill Details:**
- **Location**: Library skill (`.claude/skill-library/prompting/orchestration-prompt-patterns/`)
- **Category**: `prompting` (prompt engineering patterns)
- **Type**: Process/Pattern
- **Purpose**: Provide reusable, copy-paste prompt engineering patterns for multi-agent orchestration workflows

**Structure:**
- SKILL.md (200 lines) - Main entry point with pattern selection guide, usage examples, anti-patterns
- references/few-shot-patterns.md - TDD examples, test case patterns, source analysis patterns
- references/chain-of-thought-patterns.md - Spec compliance verification, decision chains, conflict detection
- references/self-consistency-patterns.md - Two-pass review, alternative perspectives, multi-path synthesis
- references/progressive-disclosure-patterns.md - Question levels for brainstorming, clarification gates for developers
- references/confidence-calibration.md - Evidence-based confidence scoring, quality assessment calibration

**Integration:**
- Called by: Orchestration skills, agent definitions, skill creators
- Requires: None (reference library skill)
- Calls: None (terminal skill)
- Pairs with: orchestrating-research, developing-with-tdd, debugging-systematically

**Design Decisions:**
- Progressive disclosure: SKILL.md < 500 lines (221 after REFACTOR), detailed patterns in references/
- Copy-paste format: Each pattern includes complete code blocks that can be embedded directly
- Pattern combinations: Documents how to layer patterns (e.g., Chain-of-Thought + Self-Consistency for architecture)
- Maintenance triggers: When to update patterns based on agent bypass, new agent types, pattern failures

**REFACTOR Phase (Pressure Testing):**
- Identified bypass scenario: "I already know these patterns" / "Too simple for patterns"
- Added "When NOT to Skip Patterns" section with rationalization table
- Counter: Explicitly documents when patterns are truly optional vs required
- Evidence: "The 5 minutes to reference this skill prevents hours debugging"
- Result: Skill resistant to complexity-aversion and time-pressure bypasses
