# Changelog - discovering-reusable-code

## 2025-12-30 - Initial Creation

**RED Phase Documentation:**
- **Gap**: Implementations add `if newFeature {}` special-casing throughout codebase instead of extending existing patterns because developers don't know what patterns exist to extend
- **Failure**: PR feedback showed feature implementation added special-case conditionals to 8 functions instead of extending existing handler chain pattern
- **Root Cause**: No exhaustive discovery methodology before implementation

**Location**: Core (.claude/skills/)
**Skill Type**: Process/Pattern
**Purpose**: Define methodology for exhaustive reuse discovery to prevent special-casing anti-patterns

**Key Content**:
- Exhaustive search methodology with actual bash commands
- Reusability assessment matrix (100%/80%/60%/40%/0%)
- 10-file rule before proposing new code
- Discovery report format with compliance confirmation
- Validation criteria and anti-pattern detection

**Line Count**: 364 lines (under 500 limit)
