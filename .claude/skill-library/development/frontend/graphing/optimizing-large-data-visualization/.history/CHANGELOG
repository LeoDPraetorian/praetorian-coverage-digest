# Changelog - optimizing-large-data-visualization

All notable changes to this skill will be documented in this file.

## [1.0.0] - 2026-01-14

### Added - Initial Creation

**RED Phase Documentation:**
- Problem: Rendering large datasets (1000+ items) causes render blocking (5-30s), scroll lag (<15 FPS), memory pressure
- Current state: Developers lack concrete optimization patterns, decision matrices, and performance targets
- Gap: No centralized guidance on when/how to apply LOD, viewport culling, spatial indexing, virtualization

**Skill Metadata:**
- Category: library-skill (frontend)
- Type: Process/Pattern
- Location: .claude/skill-library/frontend/optimizing-large-data-visualization/

- Strategy selection matrix by data size and interaction type
- Performance targets with measurement methods
- Anti-patterns with solutions
- Integration workflow for incremental adoption
- Library comparison table
- References to existing research: .claude/.output/discovery/20250114-graph-explorer/research-synthesis.md

**Research Sources:**
