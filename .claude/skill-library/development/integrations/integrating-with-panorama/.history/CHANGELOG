# Changelog - integrating-with-panorama

## 2026-01-03 - Initial Creation

**Phase:** RED → GREEN → REFACTOR

**Category:** development/integrations/

**Skill Type:** Integration

**RED Phase Documentation:**
- **Gap Identified:** No existing skill for Palo Alto Panorama integration
- **Failure Without Skill:** Developer receives generic API integration advice without Panorama-specific context (device groups, templates, shared policies, authentication methods, XML vs REST API trade-offs)
- **Test Scenario:** Developer asks "How do I integrate with Palo Alto Panorama?" and gets incomplete guidance missing critical Panorama architecture concepts
- **Gap Proven:** Search of .claude/ directory confirmed no existing Panorama integration documentation

**Implementation:**
- Created skill at `.claude/skill-library/development/integrations/integrating-with-panorama/`
- Initial SKILL.md generated with progressive disclosure structure (409 lines)
- Prepared references/ directory for detailed content population
- Prepared examples/ directory for implementation examples

**Research Completed:**
- Phase 6.1: Conducted comprehensive research via orchestrating-research skill
- Phase 6.2: Parallel research across Context7, Perplexity, Classic Web (24 agents spawned)
- Phase 6.3: Targeted research on commit operations (gap filling)
- Phase 6.4: Comprehensive API endpoint research (REST + XML catalogs)

**Research Artifacts:**
- `.claude/research/2026-01-03-154111-panorama-integration/` - Initial comprehensive research (10 files)
  - API architecture, authentication, device groups, security policies, rate limiting, automation
- `.claude/research/2026-01-03-161615-panorama-commit-ops-targeted/` - Commit operations targeted research (1 file, 55KB)
  - Mandatory two-step workflow, job monitoring, error handling, rollback procedures
- `.claude/research/2026-01-03-165242-panorama-api-complete/` - Complete API endpoint reference (9 files, 160KB+)
  - REST API complete endpoint catalog
  - XML API operations, XPath patterns, action types, operational commands
  - Implementation patterns in Python, Go, TypeScript

**Reference Files Created:**
- `references/rest-api-reference.md` - Complete REST API endpoint catalog with schemas
- `references/xml-api-reference.md` - Complete XML API operations with XPath patterns and code examples

**Gateway Updated:**
- Added to gateway-integrations2 routing table

**Next Steps:**
- Phase 8: GREEN verification that skill addresses the gap
- Phase 9: REFACTOR with pressure testing

## 2026-01-03 - Comprehensive API Research Completed
