## 2026-01-19 - Phase 13 Compliance Fix

**Issue:** Phase 13 (TodoWrite Mandate) - Weak TodoWrite mandate needs strengthening

**Fix Applied:** Claude-Automated
- Replaced casual reminder with EXTREMELY-IMPORTANT block
- Added explicit 6-item TodoWrite checklist
- Added rationalization counters for common skip patterns
- Added consequence statement for violations
- Status: ✅ PASS

**Before:**
```markdown
> **You MUST use TodoWrite** before starting to track all search workflow steps.
```

**After:**
```markdown
<EXTREMELY-IMPORTANT>
**TodoWrite is MANDATORY before any search operation.**

You MUST create a TodoWrite todo list with these items BEFORE proceeding:

1. Navigate to repository root
2. Get search query from user
3. Search core skills by name and description
4. Search library skills by name and description
5. Score and sort results by relevance
6. Format and present search results

**This is NOT optional. This is NOT negotiable.**

- ❌ "This is just a quick search" → Use TodoWrite anyway
- ❌ "I already know the workflow" → TodoWrite makes progress visible to user
- ❌ "It's only 6 steps" → TodoWrite is mandatory for ANY multi-step workflow
- ❌ "The user wants fast results" → TodoWrite IS fast and provides transparency

**If you skip TodoWrite, you are violating this skill's requirements.**
</EXTREMELY-IMPORTANT>
```

**Audit Result:** Phase 13 now compliant

## 2026-01-19 - Phase 1 Compliance Fix

**Issue:** Phase 1 (Description Format) - Description exceeded 120 character limit (243 chars)

**Fix Applied:** Claude-Automated
- Condensed description from 243 to 118 characters
- Preserved core meaning: keyword search, core+library, fuzzy matching, scored results
- Removed implementation details (moved to skill body)
- Status: ✅ PASS

**Before:**
```yaml
description: Use when finding skills by keyword - searches both core (.claude/skills/) and library (.claude/skill-library/) locations with fuzzy matching, scoring algorithm (exact > substring > fuzzy), and instruction-based workflow or via auditing-skills CLI
```

**After:**
```yaml
description: Use when finding skills by keyword - searches core and library with fuzzy matching, scored results (exact > substring)
```

**Audit Result:** PASSED (all 30 phases compliant)
