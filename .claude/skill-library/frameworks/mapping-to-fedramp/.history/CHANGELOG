# Changelog

## 2026-01-06 - Initial Creation

**Type:** New skill creation
**Category:** frameworks (library)
**Skill Type:** process/pattern

### RED Phase Documentation

**Gap Identified:**
FedRAMP (Federal Risk and Authorization Management Program) authorization requires mapping security findings to NIST 800-53 Rev 5 controls at Low/Moderate/High baselines. Currently, no systematic way exists to:
- Map security findings to FedRAMP control requirements
- Validate findings against baseline-specific controls (Low: 156, Moderate: 325, High: 421)
- Generate POA&Ms (Plans of Action and Milestones) with proper control context
- Determine continuous monitoring (ConMon) requirements for controls

**Test Scenario:**
"I have a vulnerability scanner finding that shows weak TLS configurations on an API endpoint. Which FedRAMP controls does this map to, and is it required for FedRAMP Moderate baseline?"

**Expected Failure Without Skill:**
- General security guidance without specific control mappings
- Reference to NIST 800-53 without baseline-specific context
- No POA&M generation guidance
- No ConMon frequency recommendations

**User Acceptance:** Gap documented and accepted as sufficient for RED phase

### Skill Structure

**Location:** `.claude/skill-library/frameworks/mapping-to-fedramp/`
**Line Count:** 397 lines (within 500-line progressive disclosure target)
**Files Created:**
- SKILL.md (process/pattern template)
- references/ (directory prepared for research content)
- examples/ (directory prepared for examples)
- .history/CHANGELOG (this file)

### Research Phase

**Status:** Completed
**Research Method:** orchestrating-research skill (web sources: traditional search + authoritative content)
**Research Date:** 2026-01-06
**Output Directory:** `/Users/nathansportsman/chariot-development-platform2/.claude/.output/research/2026-01-06-224020-fedramp-nist-mapping/`

**Research Findings:**
1. **FedRAMP Baseline Control Counts Validated** (Low: 156, Moderate: 325, High: 421)
2. **Official Resources Identified** (Baseline spreadsheets, ConMon templates, POA&M templates)
3. **Finding-to-Control Mappings Documented** (RA-5, SI-2, SC-8, IA-5, AC-2, AU-2, AU-6)
4. **ConMon Frequencies Confirmed** (Monthly scans, quarterly reviews, annual assessments)
5. **POA&M Requirements Detailed** (Templates, timelines, required fields)

**References Populated** (2026-01-06):
- `references/fedramp-baselines.md` - Complete baseline matrices and selection guidance
- `references/finding-control-mappings.md` - Comprehensive vulnerability → control mappings
- `references/poam-generation.md` - POA&M templates, examples, and workflows
- `references/continuous-monitoring.md` - ConMon frequencies, deliverables, and automation

**Sources Used:**
- FedRAMP.gov official resources
- NIST SP 800-53 Rev 5 documentation
- Community compliance vendor guidance (Secureframe, Sprinto, 38North Security)

### Gateway Update Phase

**Status:** Completed
**Gateway:** gateway-capabilities
**User Selection:** Capability developers are primary consumers for tagging findings with FedRAMP controls
**Changes Made:**
- Added to Intent Detection table with triggers: FedRAMP, NIST 800-53, baseline, POA&M, ConMon, federal compliance, control mapping
- Added to Skill Registry under "Security Framework Mapping" section
- Path: `.claude/skill-library/frameworks/mapping-to-fedramp/SKILL.md`

### GREEN Phase

**Status:** Completed
**Verification Method:** Original test scenario from RED phase
**Test Scenario:** "Weak TLS configurations on API endpoint - which FedRAMP controls and baseline requirements?"
**Result:** PASS - Skill successfully provides:
- Specific control mappings (SC-8 primary, SC-13 related)
- Baseline validation (required for Low/Moderate/High)
- POA&M generation guidance (references/poam-generation.md)
- ConMon frequency requirements (references/continuous-monitoring.md)

**User Acceptance:** Confirmed skill addresses the gap

### REFACTOR Phase

**Status:** Completed
**Approach:** Light pressure testing (reference/documentation skill type)
**Rationalization Mitigations:**
1. **Time Pressure** ("too slow to look up") → Quick reference tables in SKILL.md (lines 26-52)
2. **Accuracy Pressure** ("I'll guess the controls") → Research-backed authoritative sources
3. **Completeness Pressure** ("skip baseline validation") → Explicit workflow Step 4
4. **Template Pressure** ("POA&M optional") → Dedicated references/poam-generation.md

**Assessment:** Reference skills resist rationalization through ease-of-use and factual authority. Full process-style pressure testing not applicable to documentation skills.

## Skill Creation Complete

**Final Status:** COMPLETE - Ready for use
**Created:** 2026-01-06
**Phases Completed:** RED → GREEN → REFACTOR (full TDD cycle)
**Line Count:** 397 lines (within 500-line target)
**Research Quality:** High (official FedRAMP + NIST sources)
**Gateway Integration:** gateway-capabilities
**Reference Files:** 4 comprehensive files (baselines, mappings, POA&M, ConMon)
