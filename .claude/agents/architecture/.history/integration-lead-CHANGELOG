# integration-lead Changelog

## [1.0.0] - 2026-01-12

### Created
- Initial creation of integration-lead agent
- Follows frontend-lead pattern adapted for integration architecture
- Specializes in Chariot integration P0 requirements:
  - VMFilter initialization and usage
  - CheckAffiliation design (real API query vs stub)
  - ValidateCredentials implementation
  - errgroup concurrency patterns
  - Pagination safety (maxPages)
  - Tabularium model mapping

### Architecture Decisions
- Auth flow design (OAuth2, API key, JWT, HMAC, Basic)
- Pagination strategy selection (token, page, cursor, SDK-based)
- errgroup pattern selection (standard, shared state, continue-on-error)
- Rate limiting strategy design
- File structure for large integrations (>400 lines split)

### Workflow
- integration-lead (architecture) → integration-developer (implementation) → backend-reviewer (validation)
- Updated integration-developer to reference integration-lead instead of backend-lead

### Skills
- Uses gateway-integrations + gateway-backend for routing
- Mandates developing-integrations skill for P0 compliance
- Inherits architect patterns from frontend-lead

### Output Format
- output_type: "integration-architecture" or "integration-refactor-plan"
- handoff.next_agent: "integration-developer"
- Plan includes P0 Compliance Checklist (pre-filled)
