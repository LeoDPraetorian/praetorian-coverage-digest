## 2024-12-30 - Add Prioritization Algorithm

**Update Type:** Feature addition (scoring formula)

**Changes:**
- Added weighted prioritization algorithm to Phase 3 with research-backed weights:
  - Popularity (stars): 40%
  - Maintenance (days since commit): 35%
  - Forks: 15%
  - Issue Health (fewer open issues): 10%
- Created references/prioritization-algorithm.md with:
  - Full normalization formulas for each component
  - Worked example (uber-go/ratelimit: score 0.60)
  - Edge case handling (new repos, archived repos, 0 issues)
  - Customization guidance for different use cases
  - Research basis citing npms.io, GitHub trending, Snyk Advisor
- Updated Phase 6 output format to include scores in repository listings
- Maintains line count under 500 (currently ~500 after additions)

**Rationale:**
Research into npms.io (35% maintenance, 35% popularity), GitHub trending (velocity-based), and Snyk Advisor (maintenance = popularity) shows professional ranking systems weight maintenance equal to or higher than popularity. Our weights prioritize stars slightly higher (40%) since GitHub repos lack download metrics.

**Line Count Impact:** +29 lines in SKILL.md (471 → 500), detailed content in references/

## 2024-12-30 - Initial Creation

**RED Phase Documentation:**

Gap identified: No systematic GitHub research workflow in the researching-skills router. When asked to find GitHub repositories, code patterns, or issues, Claude would:
- Use generic WebSearch without detecting gh CLI availability
- Miss quality assessment framework (stars, license, activity, docs)
- Skip dual-tool strategy (gh CLI primary, web fallback)
- Not follow structured 6-phase workflow

**Skill Details:**
- **Category:** skill-library/claude/skill-management
- **Type:** Process/Pattern
- **Location:** Library (sibling to researching-arxiv, researching-codebase, researching-context7, researching-web)

**Key Features:**
- 6-phase workflow (Environment & Query → Search → Filter → Inspect → Extract → Synthesize)
- Dual-tool strategy (gh CLI primary with web fallback)
- Quality indicators (✅ High Quality, ⚠️ Medium, 🔍 Evaluate, ❌ Skip)
- Durable code references (function signatures, not line numbers)
- Structured synthesis with citations

**References Created:**
- references/gh-cli-commands.md - Complete gh CLI reference
- references/search-filters.md - GitHub search filter syntax
- references/quality-indicators.md - Repository quality assessment criteria
- references/output-format.md - Synthesis template
- references/query-formulation.md - Query patterns
- references/deep-inspection.md - Phase 4 inspection methodology

**Line Count:** 448 lines (under 500-line limit)

**Next Steps:**
- Phase 7: Update researching-skills router to include researching-github
- Phase 8: GREEN verification (test skill works)
- Phase 9: REFACTOR with pressure testing
