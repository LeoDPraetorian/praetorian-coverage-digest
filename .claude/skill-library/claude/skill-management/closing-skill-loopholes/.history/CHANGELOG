## 2026-01-06 - Initial Creation

**Phase**: RED-GREEN-REFACTOR TDD Cycle

**RED Phase - Gap Documentation:**

**Problem**: Agents rationalize skipping skill instructions despite explicit requirements.

**Failure Evidence** (from .claude/.output/research/AGENTS-NOT-FOLLOWING-DIRECTIONS.md):

1. **mcp-lead agent** asked to "analyze Serena connection pool":
   - Did NOT invoke `persisting-agent-outputs` skill
   - Did NOT write output to file
   - Returned inline response instead

2. **mcp-lead3 hallucinated description**:
   - Actual: "Use when starting any conversation or performing any task"
   - Hallucinated: "Use when analyzing, creating, or modifying skills"
   - Used fabricated description to justify skipping skill

3. **Non-deterministic compliance**:
   - mcp-lead2 invoked 5-7 skills on same task across different runs
   - 40% variance in skill invocation behavior

**Test Scenario**: When agents complete work requiring file artifacts and specific skill invocations, they rationalize skipping requirements.

**Location**: `.claude/skill-library/claude/skill-management/closing-skill-loopholes/`

**Category**: claude/skill-management

**Skill Type**: Process/Pattern (TDD methodology for closing agent compliance loopholes)

**Key Features**:
- RED-GREEN-REFACTOR workflow for systematic loophole closure
- Rationalization pattern taxonomy (8 common patterns)
- Counter placement decision tree (agent/skill/universal scope)
- Loophole tracking in `.claude/docs/AGENT-LOOPHOLES.md`
- Description trap detection (WHEN vs HOW)
- Anti-rationalization reference table

**Methodology**: Based on obra/superpowers pressure testing approach with TDD cycles.
