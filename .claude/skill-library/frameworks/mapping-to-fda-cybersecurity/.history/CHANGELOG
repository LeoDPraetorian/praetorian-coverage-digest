## 2026-01-07 - Initial Creation

**Type:** Creation
**Category:** frameworks
**Skill Type:** Library/Framework

### RED Phase Documentation

**Gap Identified:** Claude has no structured knowledge of FDA medical device cybersecurity guidance.

**Test Scenario:** "I'm scanning a medical device and found an SQL injection vulnerability. What FDA cybersecurity documentation do I need for this finding?"

**Failure Without Skill:**
- ❌ Provides generic vulnerability remediation advice
- ❌ References HIPAA or other healthcare regulations instead of FDA device-specific guidance
- ❌ Misses FDA's dual-axis severity framework (exploitability + patient harm impact)
- ❌ Does not mention premarket (510(k)) vs postmarket surveillance requirements
- ❌ Overlooks SBOM (Software Bill of Materials) documentation requirements
- ❌ Does not reference the 2023 FDA Premarket Cybersecurity Guidance
- ❌ Misses coordinated vulnerability disclosure timelines

### Skill Purpose

Help capability developers map security findings to FDA medical device cybersecurity requirements for regulatory compliance and patient safety. Provides:

1. Premarket guidance requirements (2023 FDA guidance)
2. Postmarket management requirements
3. SBOM (Software Bill of Materials) requirements and templates
4. Vulnerability severity classification (exploitability + patient harm)
5. Coordinated vulnerability disclosure requirements and timelines
6. Device classification (Class I/II/III) cybersecurity requirements

### Structure

- Location: `.claude/skill-library/frameworks/mapping-to-fda-cybersecurity/`
- Type: Library/Framework skill
- Line count: 434 lines (within 450-500 safe zone)
- Progressive disclosure: Main content in SKILL.md, detailed references planned

### Research Status

**Completed** - Phase 6 research execution and incorporation (2026-01-07)

**Research Output Directory:** `.claude/.output/research/2026-01-07-231623-fda-medical-device-cybersecurity/`

**Research Coverage:**
- 8 research agents spawned (4 interpretations × 2 sources: Perplexity + Classic Web)
- 4 interpretations researched:
  1. Premarket (510(k)) requirements
  2. Postmarket vulnerability management
  3. Severity classification framework
  4. Vulnerability to requirements mapping

**Reference Files Created:**
- `references/premarket-requirements.md` - Complete 510(k) cybersecurity checklist (Section 524B, SBOM, eSTAR template)
- `references/postmarket-requirements.md` - CVD timelines, MDR triggers, PATCH Act, CISA coordination
- `references/severity-classification.md` - Dual-axis framework, ISO 14971 harm levels, MITRE CVSS rubric, Tier 1/2 classification
- `references/sbom-templates.md` - SPDX/CycloneDX examples, FDA-specific properties, VEX integration

**Key Research Findings:**
- FDA does NOT mandate SBOM formats (SPDX/CycloneDX voluntary)
- 15% of submissions receive RTA letters for inadequate documentation
- 700% increase in FDA deficiency letters since PATCH Act (October 2023)
- Cybersecurity tiers (Tier 1/Tier 2) are INDEPENDENT of device class (I/II/III)
- 93% of manufacturers fail to meet 30-60 day CVD timelines (average 4.5-6 months)
- Only 27 of top 40 manufacturers maintain public CVD programs

**Confidence:** 0.87 (High) based on official FDA guidance, statutory requirements, peer-reviewed research
