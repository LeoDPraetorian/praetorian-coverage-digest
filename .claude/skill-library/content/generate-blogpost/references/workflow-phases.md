# Workflow Phases - Detailed Guidance

Comprehensive implementation details for each workflow phase. See SKILL.md for overview.

## Phase 1: Source Analysis

**Understand the project**:
- Read README and documentation
- Trace execution flow through code
- Extract core concepts (3-5 key ideas)
- Identify interesting implementation details

## Phase 2: Voice Capture

**Multi-dimensional style analysis**:
- Tone & Energy (conversational vs formal)
- Technical Depth (assumed knowledge level)
- Structure & Flow (narrative patterns)
- Personality & Humor (characteristic markers)
- Code Integration (how examples appear)

Create voice profile documenting each dimension with examples.

## Phase 3: Research Execution

Use orchestrating-research or manual WebSearch to find:
- Prior art and related work
- Community perspective
- Alternative approaches
- Attribution requirements

## Phase 4: Content Synthesis

Combine analysis + voice + research:
- Choose narrative structure (problem→solution / journey / deep-dive)
- Map concepts to narrative beats
- Plan technical-to-accessible translation
- Integrate research citations naturally

## Phase 5: Draft Generation

Write section-by-section:
- Apply voice actively (check profile frequently)
- Maintain narrative momentum
- Keep code examples focused
- Sustain personality throughout

## Phase 6: Verification

Multi-pass verification:
1. Technical accuracy (code, claims, paths)
2. Voice consistency (tone, depth, personality)
3. Research attribution (credits, links)
4. Narrative flow (transitions, coherence)
