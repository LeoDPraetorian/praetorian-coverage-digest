# Changelog

## 2026-01-04 - Initial Creation

**Why Created:**
Extracted embedded Security Review Framework and Review Process from backend-security agent to enable reuse and reduce agent bloat from 204 to ~130 lines.

**RED Phase Documentation:**
- **Gap**: backend-security.md contained embedded framework (OWASP Top 10, Go patterns, severity classification, findings template)
- **Failure**: Framework inaccessible to other agents needing security review patterns, violated lean agent architecture (<150 lines)
- **Test Scenario**: Other security reviewers (capability-developer, frontend-security) would need to duplicate framework content

**Skill Details:**
- **Category**: security (library skill)
- **Type**: Process/Pattern
- **Location**: `.claude/skill-library/security/reviewing-backend-security/SKILL.md`
- **Line Count**: 144 lines (safe, well under 500 limit)

**Content Extracted:**
1. OWASP Top 10 Focus list (Injection, Broken auth, Sensitive data, etc.)
2. Go-Specific Patterns (Race conditions, Context.Context, Prepared statements, TLS, Error handling)
3. Severity Classification table (CRITICAL, HIGH, MEDIUM, LOW with examples)
4. Review Process: Write Security Findings (complete markdown template)

**Next Steps:**
- Research phase to populate additional content
- Update gateway-security routing table
- Update backend-security.md to reference this skill
- GREEN phase verification
- REFACTOR phase pressure testing
