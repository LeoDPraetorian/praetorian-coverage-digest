## 2025-12-29 - Add enforcing-evidence-based-analysis to mandatory universal skills

### Changed
- **Phase 13 (workflow-manual-checks.md)**: Added `enforcing-evidence-based-analysis` to MANDATORY universal skills
- **Universal skills now 3**: `calibrating-time-estimates`, `enforcing-evidence-based-analysis`, `verifying-before-completion`
- **Terminology fix**: Changed "Tier 1" to "Step 1" in fix guidance section
- **Verification script**: Updated bash loop to check for all 3 skills
- **Example outputs**: Updated to show all 3 skills being checked

### Why
- `enforcing-evidence-based-analysis` prevents hallucinations by requiring agents to read source files before implementing
- Aligns with gold standard agents that use this skill in Step 1
- Consistent terminology (Step 1 not Tier 1)

### Impact
- All agents will be audited for 3 mandatory skills instead of 2
- Agents missing `enforcing-evidence-based-analysis` will get WARNING
- More accurate guidance reduces hallucination issues

## 2025-12-29

### Changed
- Updated Step 2 phase descriptions to highlight Phase 9 validates correct patterns
- Added explicit mention of Phase 9 checking: Step 1/2/3 structure, two-tier system, Core Responsibilities, output format

### Why
The SKILL.md needed to align with the corrected workflow-manual-checks.md Phase 9, which now validates:
- Step 1/2/3 (NOT Tier 1/2/3)
- Two-tier skill system (Skill tool for core, Read for library)
- Core Responsibilities section
- Output format with skills_invoked + library_skills_read

### Impact
- Users know Phase 9 validates the actual gold standard patterns
- Clear what structural elements are checked during audit

### Line Count
- Before: 125 lines
- After: 126 lines (+1 line)

### Note
This skill primarily routes to workflow-manual-checks.md which was updated separately with comprehensive Phase 9 corrections.
