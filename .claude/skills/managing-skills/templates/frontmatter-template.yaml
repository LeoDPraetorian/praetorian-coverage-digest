# Field Specifications

## name (required)
- Lowercase letters, numbers, hyphens only
- No spaces, underscores, dots, or special characters
- Max 64 characters
- Use verb-first gerunds for processes (creating-, testing-, debugging-)
- Examples: my-skill, data-processing, react-testing-patterns

## description (required)
- Max 1,024 characters total
- Target: 300-500 characters (concise but complete)
- Must include BOTH triggers AND functionality
- Written in third person
- Start with "Use when..." to focus on triggering conditions
- Include specific keywords for discovery

### Description Structure
Use when [trigger 1], [trigger 2], or [trigger 3] - [what it does in one sentence]. [Optional: Additional context or technology specificity]

### Description Examples

# Technique skill
description: Use when tests have race conditions, timing dependencies, or pass/fail inconsistently - replaces arbitrary timeouts with condition polling for reliable async tests

# Technology-specific skill
description: Use when using React Router and handling authentication redirects - provides patterns for protected routes and auth state management with TypeScript

# Reference skill
description: Use when working with PDF files, extracting text, filling forms, or merging documents - comprehensive guide to pdf-lib API with TypeScript examples

# Pattern skill
description: Use when reducing code complexity, eliminating duplication, or refactoring tangled logic - provides systematic approach to simplifying complex code while preserving behavior

## allowed-tools (REQUIRED)
- Comma-separated list of tools
- Documents which tools the skill uses
- Improves transparency and discoverability
- Common tools: Read, Write, Edit, Bash, Grep, Glob, Task, Skill

### How to Determine allowed-tools

**Analyze your skill:**
- Does it read files? → Read
- Does it create/modify files? → Write, Edit
- Does it search code? → Grep, Glob
- Does it run commands? → Bash
- Does it spawn subagents? → Task
- Does it invoke other skills? → Skill

**Common patterns:**
- Read-only analysis: `Read, Grep, Glob`
- File creation: `Read, Write, Bash, Grep`
- Full development: `Read, Write, Edit, Bash, Grep, Glob`
- Orchestration: `Read, Write, Task, Skill`

### allowed-tools Examples

# Read-only skill
allowed-tools: Read, Grep, Glob

# Write-capable skill
allowed-tools: Read, Write, Edit, Grep, Glob

# Full development skill
allowed-tools: Read, Write, Edit, Bash, Grep, Glob, Task, Skill

# Script execution skill
allowed-tools: Read, Bash

## Validation

Before deployment, verify:
- ✅ All required fields present: name, description, allowed-tools
- ✅ Name uses valid characters only (lowercase, hyphens)
- ✅ Description under 1,024 characters
- ✅ Description MUST start with "Use when..."
- ✅ Description in third person (no "you/your")
- ✅ allowed-tools field specifies permitted tools
- ✅ YAML syntax valid (opening ---, closing ---)
- ✅ No extra fields (only name, description, allowed-tools supported)

## Common Mistakes

❌ name: "My Skill" (spaces, capitals)
❌ name: skill_name (underscores)
❌ description: I can help... (first person)
❌ description: For working with data (vague, no triggers)
❌ allowed-tools: all (not a valid value - omit field instead)
❌ Missing opening or closing --- in YAML
❌ Indentation with tabs (use spaces)
