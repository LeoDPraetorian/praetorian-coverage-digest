# Changelog

## [Initial Creation] - 2026-01-01

### Added
- Initial skill creation with TDD workflow
- RED phase: Documented gap in research query generation
  - Research skills use template-guided queries, not semantic intent analysis
  - Missing: multiple interpretation generation, gap identification, prioritized clarifications
  - Test failure: "research authentication" generates 3 linear queries instead of exploring OAuth/JWT/Basic/MFA interpretation space
- Two execution modes:
  - `analyze` mode: Structured JSON output for research/automation (no user interaction)
  - `interactive` mode: AskUserQuestion for high-priority clarifications
- Core capabilities: Parse & Decompose, Identify Gaps, Document Assumptions, Generate Clarifications
- Integration patterns for research skills and implementation planning

### Category
- Location: core
- Skill Type: process/pattern

### Research Enhancements - 2026-01-01

#### Research Conducted
- GitHub: Instructor (12K⭐), Pydantic-AI (14K⭐), Outlines (13K⭐), snips-nlu, JointBERT
- arxiv: 7 papers on intent recognition, AMD framework (SIGKDD 2025), query expansion
- Perplexity/Web: ConRAP (87% F2), AQE (70% time reduction), INVEST criteria
- Web: 11 requirements techniques, Haystack patterns, 50% defect statistic

#### Enhancements Added
- **Ambiguity categorization**: Added `ambiguity_type` field (vagueness|incompleteness|referential|scope) to clarification output
- **Confidence thresholds**: Explicit scoring guidance (>0.9 high, 0.6-0.9 medium, <0.6 low)
- **Workflow Phase 2**: Added ambiguity detection & categorization with indicators table
- **Workflow Phase 4**: Added clarification generation with 5-step process
- **Confidence field**: Added to analyze mode output schema

#### Reference Files Populated
- parsing-strategies.md: Schema-driven parsing, dependency mapping, Plan-and-Solve patterns
- gap-analysis.md: 4 gap categories, detection signals, confidence scoring
- clarification-templates.md: Funnel technique, templates by ambiguity type, priority filtering
- assumption-patterns.md: Security/performance/architecture defaults
- research-integration.md: AMD framework integration, query expansion workflow
- planning-integration.md: Interactive mode integration with planning agents

### Context
- Based on deleted `intent-translator` agent (git history)
- Purpose: Enable semantic query expansion for research workflows
- Integration point: `researching-skills` will consume analyze mode output
