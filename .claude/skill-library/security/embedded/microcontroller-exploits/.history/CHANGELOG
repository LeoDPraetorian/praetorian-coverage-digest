All notable changes to this skill will be documented in this file.

## [3.0.0] - 2026-01-13

### Added - Vision-Based Figure Descriptions

**Full conversion with image descriptions using sub-agent batch processing.**

**Process:**
1. Pandoc EPUB→markdown conversion
2. Extract 249 images from EPUB
3. Spawn 4 sub-agents (Sonnet model) to describe images in batches
4. Inject 239 figure descriptions into markdown
5. Split into 35 chapter files

**Sub-agent batches:**
- Batch 1 (Opus): Images 1-55 (55 images)
- Batch 2 (Sonnet): Images 56-125 (70 images)
- Batch 3 (Sonnet): Images 126-207 (82 images)
- Batch 4 (Sonnet): Images 208-249 (42 images)

**Content improvements:**
- 239 figure descriptions embedded (die photos, schematics, code listings, memory maps)
- Each description 50-100 words focusing on technical details and attack points
- Total: 9,359 lines across 35 files (up from 8,645)

**Cost optimization:** Used Sonnet model for image processing sub-agents after first batch.

## [2.0.0] - 2026-01-13

### Changed - Regenerated with Pandoc

**Reason:** Testing revealed Pandoc produces significantly better output than native sed/awk conversion.

**Improvements over v1.0.0:**
- Cross-references preserved as links (`[Chapter 4](#ch04.xhtml_ch04)`)
- Figure references include image links with IDs
- All HTML entities properly decoded (em-dashes, smart quotes, Ω, etc.)
- Correct chapter ordering (follows OPF spine, not alphabetical)
- Semantic code formatting with `{.literal}` spans

**Content structure:**
- Introduction + 25 chapters (practical exploits)
- 9 appendices (extended case studies)
- Total: 8,645 lines across 35 files (up from 5,510 due to better formatting)
- All files well under 25,000 token limit

**Conversion method:** `pandoc book.epub -t markdown -o book.md`

## [1.0.0] - 2026-01-13

### Added - Initial Skill Creation

**Source**: Microcontroller Exploits by Travis Goodspeed (No Starch Press)
**Format**: EPUB converted to markdown using `converting-epub-to-markdown` skill

**Conversion process:**
1. Extracted EPUB (71MB, contains many images)
2. Combined HTML files in OPF spine order
3. Multi-pass HTML-to-markdown conversion (sed/awk)
4. Split into 35 chapter/appendix files

**Content structure:**
- Introduction + 25 chapters (practical exploits)
- 9 appendices (extended case studies)
- Total: 5,510 lines across 35 files
- All files well under 25,000 token limit

**Topics covered:**
- Memory extraction fundamentals
- Bootloader vulnerabilities (DFU, USB recovery)
- JTAG/SWD debugging attacks
- Fault injection and voltage glitching
