# Changelog

All notable changes to this skill.

- **2026-01-13**: Add support for both MCP wrapper and REST API wrapper creation workflows. The create subcommand now asks users what type of tool they're wrapping via AskUserQuestion, then routes to either `orchestrating-mcp-development` (for MCP servers like Context7, Perplexity) or `orchestrating-api-tool-development` (for REST APIs like Shodan, Linear). Updated skill description, title, and examples to reflect both wrapper types. Added AskUserQuestion to allowed-tools.

- **2026-01-04**: Update Quick Reference table and section header to reference `orchestrating-mcp-development` instead of `creating-mcp-wrappers`. This aligns with the new multi-agent orchestration workflow for 100% tool coverage.

- **2025-12-01**: Fix phase count maintenance issue - adding a new audit phase requires updating 12+ places manually.

## Problem
When Phase 11 was added, these weren't updated:
- SKILL.md frontmatter description (10 phases → 11)
- SKILL.md body references
- references/new-workflow.md (2 places)
- references/update-workflow.md (2 places)
- docs/MCP-TOOLS-ARCHITECTURE.md (6 places)
- cli.ts validation (hardcoded 1-10)

## Solution
1. **Make CLI dynamic**: Export PHASES.length from audit.ts, use in cli.ts validation
2. **Update all '10 phases' → '11 phases'** in documentation listed above
3. **Add 'Adding New Phases' section** to references/audit-workflow.md with checklist:
   - Create phases/phase{N}-{name}.ts
   - Register in audit.ts PHASES array
   - Register in fix.ts FIXERS array
   - Update SKILL.md table and description
   - Update references/*.md
   - Update docs/MCP-TOOLS-ARCHITECTURE.md
   - CLI validation auto-updates (if made dynamic)

4. **Consider**: Add script to find all 'N phase' references for future audits
