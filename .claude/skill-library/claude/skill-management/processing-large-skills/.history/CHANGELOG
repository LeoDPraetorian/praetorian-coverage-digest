## 2026-01-19 - Phase 30 Compliance (Audit-Driven)

**Method:** Claude-Automated

**Issues Fixed:**

1. **Phase 30: Skill Reference Annotations (FAIL)**
   - Added (LIBRARY) annotations to library skill references
   - Added Read() paths with absolute file paths for all library skills
   - Integration section: Updated auditing-skills, updating-skills
   - Related Skills section: Updated creating-skills, updating-skills, auditing-skills
   - Format: `skill-name (LIBRARY) - Read(".claude/skill-library/.../SKILL.md") - Purpose`

**Skills Annotated:**
- auditing-skills (LIBRARY) - `.claude/skill-library/claude/skill-management/auditing-skills/SKILL.md`
- updating-skills (LIBRARY) - `.claude/skill-library/claude/skill-management/updating-skills/SKILL.md`
- creating-skills (LIBRARY) - `.claude/skill-library/claude/skill-management/creating-skills/SKILL.md`

**Skills Confirmed CORE (no annotation):**
- persisting-agent-outputs
- managing-skills
- developing-with-tdd

**Audit Status:** Phase 30 now compliant
- All library skill references include (LIBRARY) annotation
- All library skill references include Read() paths
- Core skills correctly not annotated

**Files Modified:**
- SKILL.md (Integration section, Related Skills section)
- Backup: SKILL.md.backup

## 2026-01-19 - Compliance Fixes (Audit-Driven)

**Method:** Claude-Automated

**Issues Fixed:**

1. **Phase 26: Reference Content Quality (WARNING)**
   - Created missing `synthesis-algorithm.md` referenced in agent-prompts.md:166
   - Populated with complete synthesis workflow (Steps 1-6, error handling, success criteria)
   - Content: 9008 bytes, comprehensive coverage of Phase 4 synthesis process
   - Resolution: Broken reference now resolves correctly

2. **Phase 29: Logical Coherence (WARNING)**
   - Fixed logical coherence issue (same root cause as Phase 26)
   - agent-prompts.md reference to synthesis workflow now has destination file
   - Resolution: Workflow documentation complete and accessible

3. **Phase 28: Integration Section (Initial Assessment Error)**
   - Upon verification, Integration section was already complete with all 4 required subsections
   - Has: Called By, Requires, Calls, Pairs With
   - No fix needed - initial audit assessment was incorrect

4. **Gateway Membership (INFO)**
   - Verified skill is correctly listed in gateway-claude routing table
   - Entry: "Processing Large Skills" with path and triggers
   - No action needed - skill is discoverable

**Audit Status:** PASSED
- All structural phases compliant
- Semantic review: PASSED
- Description quality: PASSED (5/5 criteria)
- Line count: 253/500 (51% utilization)

**Files Modified:**
- Created: references/synthesis-algorithm.md (9008 bytes)
- Backup: .local/2026-01-19-08-48-57-pre-fix.bak

## 2026-01-10 - Initial Creation

**RED Phase Documentation:**

- **Gap:** When encountering skills with progressive disclosure (SKILL.md + 5-15 reference files), Claude either:
  - Reads only SKILL.md, missing detailed patterns in references
  - Reads files sequentially, losing context between files
  - Fails to synthesize how components relate to each other
  - Cannot trace dependency chains (skill A calls skill B calls skill C)

- **Test Scenario:** "Help me understand the managing-skills skill"
  - managing-skills has SKILL.md + 7 reference files + delegates to 10 library skills
  - Without systematic analysis: partial understanding, missed relationships, incomplete dependency map

- **Failure Behaviors:**
  - Reads 2-3 files, claims understanding
  - Misses that managing-skills is a router (doesn't implement, only delegates)
  - Cannot explain the full workflow from command to library skill execution
