# Changelog

All notable changes to the orchestrating-fingerprintx-development skill will be documented in this file.

## [Fix] - 2026-01-04 - Audit Compliance

### Fixed

- **Phase 4 (Broken Link)**: Fixed reference to non-existent `orchestrator-rationalizations.md` - redirected to existing `rationalization-table.md#orchestrator-level-rationalizations` which contains equivalent content
- **Phase 3 (Line Count)**: Reduced from 550 to 462 lines (16% reduction) by condensing Phase 7 and Phase 8 content that was duplicated in references/

### Changed

- **Phase 7: Validation** - Condensed detailed sub-phase checklists into summary table; full details now in `gate-checklist.md`
- **Phase 8: Integration & PR Preparation** - Removed inline PR template; now references `artifact-templates.md`

### Rationale

Audit detected:
1. Broken link to `orchestrator-rationalizations.md` (file never existed)
2. Line count 550 exceeded 500-line limit

Both fixes preserve functionality through progressive disclosure - detailed content exists in reference files, SKILL.md provides concise overview with links.

**Fix Method**: Claude-Automated (Phase 3), Hybrid (Phase 4)

## [Update] - 2026-01-04 - Live Shodan Validation

### Added

- **Phase 7.4: Live Shodan Validation** - New sub-phase using `validating-fingerprintx-live` skill
- Integration with `mcp-tools-shodan-api` for querying real-world targets
- Live validation workflow: Query Shodan → Run fingerprintx → Analyze results
- Pass/fail thresholds: 80% detection, 50% version/CPE, 20% false negative
- New output artifacts: `{protocol}-live-validation.md`, `{protocol}-shodan-targets.json`, `{protocol}-fingerprintx-results.json`
- **validating-fingerprintx-live** skill added to coordinated skills (5th coordinated skill)

### Changed

- Phase 7 now has 5 sub-phases (7.1 Build, 7.2 Unit Tests, 7.3 Docker, 7.4 Live Shodan, 7.5 Report)
- Directory Structure updated with new validation artifacts
- Related Skills table expanded with live validation and Shodan API skills

### Rationale

Docker testing validates against controlled environments but misses real-world diversity:
- Production systems have varied configurations
- Custom builds may have patches
- Network conditions differ
- Honeypots and proxies exist

Live Shodan validation ensures the plugin works against actual deployed services. Thresholds (80% detection, etc.) account for Shodan false positives while ensuring reliability.

**Gate remains BLOCKING** - all 5 sub-phases must pass before proceeding to Phase 8.

## [Update] - 2026-01-04

### Added

- **Foundational Patterns section** - New section after "When to Use" that explicitly tells users to invoke foundational orchestration skills first
- Integration with `orchestrating-multi-agent-workflows` for effort scaling, agent routing table, and token cost awareness
- Integration with `persisting-agent-outputs` for blocked status protocol and output artifact management
- Blocked agent handling guidance in references/troubleshooting.md with routing table reference

### Changed

- **Related Skills table** - Updated `orchestrating-multi-agent-workflows` description to emphasize it provides foundational patterns and should be invoked first
- **Troubleshooting reference** - Added "Agent Blocked During Phase" section with guidance on using routing table from `orchestrating-multi-agent-workflows`
- **Line count optimization** - Extracted inline MySQL example to examples/mysql-walkthrough.md reference, reducing from 532 lines to 492 lines (under 500-line limit)

### Rationale

The orchestrating-multi-agent-workflows skill was recently updated with foundational patterns that ALL specialized orchestration skills should leverage:
1. Effort Scaling (when to use 1 vs many agents, token cost awareness)
2. Agent Routing Table (how to handle blocked agents based on blocked_reason)
3. Interdependent Task Warning (multi-agent less effective for tightly coupled tasks)

The persisting-agent-outputs skill was updated with standardized blocked status fields (blocked_reason, attempted, handoff.next_agent). This update ensures the fingerprintx orchestrator explicitly references these foundational patterns rather than duplicating them.

**GREEN Phase Verification**: Users now see clear guidance to invoke foundational skills first, understand token costs (15x for multi-agent), and know how to handle blocked agents using the routing table.

## [Update] - 2025-12-31

### Added

- **Phase 6: Testing** - New dedicated phase for writing unit tests
- Integration with writing-fingerprintx-tests skill (fourth coordinated skill)
- Testing checklist: table-driven tests, edge cases, parsing/validation/building tests
- Updated output artifacts to include {protocol}_test.go in plugin directory

### Changed

- Workflow expanded from 7 to 8 phases
- Renumbered: Phase 6 (Validation) → Phase 7, Phase 7 (Integration & PR) → Phase 8
- Coordinated skills: "three specialized skills" → "four specialized skills"
- TodoWrite tracking updated to include Phase 6 (testing)
- MySQL example walkthrough updated with Phase 6 testing step
- Output artifacts location now documents plugin directory structure

### Rationale

The writing-fingerprintx-tests skill was just created to ensure comprehensive unit test coverage for fingerprintx plugins. Previously, the orchestrator mentioned running tests in Validation but didn't enforce WRITING tests. This update makes test creation an explicit phase with its own checklist, ensuring proper test coverage before validation.

**GREEN Phase Verification**: With new Phase 6, the workflow now explicitly guides test creation using established patterns (table-driven, mocks, edge cases) before moving to validation.

---

## [Initial Creation] - 2025-12-30

### Added

- Initial creation of orchestrating-fingerprintx-development skill
- 7-phase workflow with enforced gates (Protocol Research, Version Marker Research)
- Integration with three sub-skills: researching-protocols, researching-version-markers, writing-fingerprintx-modules
- TodoWrite tracking for all phases
- Comprehensive gate enforcement with rationalization prevention
- Output artifact templates and persistence strategy
- Progressive disclosure with references/ for detailed content

### Context

**RED Phase Failure Documentation**:

Current state: Fingerprintx development uses three advisory skills that say "do X first" but don't ENFORCE the workflow.

Result without this orchestrator:
- Developers skip directly to implementation without protocol research
- Missing version detection because version marker research was skipped
- Imprecise CPEs (mysql:* instead of mysql:8.0.23)
- Failed plugins that don't handle edge cases
- Technical debt with ~10% fix rate

This orchestrator makes research BLOCKING - cannot proceed to implementation until research outputs exist and pass gate conditions.

### Metadata

- **Category**: development/capabilities
- **Skill Type**: Process/Pattern (orchestrator)
- **Location**: `.claude/skill-library/development/capabilities/orchestrating-fingerprintx-development/`
- **Gateway**: gateway-capabilities

- **Coordinated Skills**: researching-protocols, researching-version-markers, writing-fingerprintx-modules

## [2026-01-06] Skill Composition Patterns Update

### RED Phase Documentation

**Gap Identified**: The orchestrating-fingerprintx-development skill lacks explicit skill composition patterns from obra/superpowers methodology. Without structured integration documentation and prompt templates, orchestrators cannot reliably understand skill dependencies and invocation patterns.

**Test scenario**: Orchestrator executing fingerprintx workflow needs to understand which skills are required vs conditional → Currently unclear from prose descriptions.

**Expected failure**: Without explicit directives and integration section, orchestrators must infer dependencies, leading to inconsistent skill invocation and missed foundational patterns.

### Changes Applied

1. **Added REQUIRED SUB-SKILLS Table** (after "Workflow (8 Phases)" header, line 89)
   - All phases: persisting-agent-outputs, orchestrating-multi-agent-workflows
   - Phase 3: researching-protocols (BLOCKING)
   - Phase 4: researching-version-markers (CONDITIONAL - if open-source)
   - Phase 5: writing-fingerprintx-modules
   - Phase 6: writing-fingerprintx-tests
   - Phase 7.4: validating-fingerprintx-live (BLOCKING)

2. **Replaced "Related Skills" with Integration Section** (line 425)
   - Called By: /fingerprintx command, gateway-capabilities
   - Requires: persisting-agent-outputs (Phase 0), orchestrating-multi-agent-workflows (Start)
   - Calls: researching-protocols (Phase 3), writing-fingerprintx-modules (Phase 5), writing-fingerprintx-tests (Phase 6)
   - Conditional: researching-version-markers (open-source), validating-fingerprintx-live (Phase 7.4)
   - Agent Skills: developing-with-tdd (Phases 5-6), verifying-before-completion (all implementation)
   - Prompt Templates: references/prompts/README.md
   - Alternative Workflows: orchestrating-capability-development

3. **Created references/prompts/ Directory**
   - `README.md` (4.2 KB) - Phase-based skill invocation guide
   - Explains skill-invocation pattern (Read tool) vs agent-dispatch pattern (Task tool)
   - Shows how to invoke library skills with proper context
   - Documents blocked status handling per phase
   - Provides structured output format with JSON metadata

4. **Condensed Foundational Patterns Section**
   - Reduced from 13 lines to 5 lines
   - Referenced Integration section for complete documentation
   - Maintained essential information about required skills
   - Freed 9 lines to stay within 500-line limit

### GREEN Phase Verification

✅ Line count: 500/500 lines (at hard limit, condensed Foundational Patterns to fit)
✅ REQUIRED SUB-SKILLS table: Added at line 89
✅ Integration section: Replaced Related Skills section at line 425
✅ Prompt templates: README.md created in references/prompts/
✅ Template explains skill-invocation pattern unique to this orchestrator
✅ Backup created: .local/SKILL.md.backup-20260106-064456

### Skill Metadata Update

- **Line Count**: 500/500 lines (was 462, added 47, condensed 9 to stay at limit)
- **Reference Files**: 8 files total (added prompts/README.md)
- **Prompt Template Pattern**: Skill-invocation (Read tool) not agent-dispatch (Task tool)

### Why This Pattern Differs

Unlike orchestrating-feature-development and orchestrating-capability-development which spawn Task agents with prompts, this orchestrator primarily **invokes library skills via Read tool**. The workflow is linear and gate-based, so the prompt template documents:

- How to invoke each library skill with Read tool
- What context to pass between phases
- Gate checklists per phase
- Blocked status handling via orchestrating-multi-agent-workflows routing table

This is the correct pattern for gate-enforced workflows that delegate to specialized library skills rather than spawning general-purpose agents.

**Status**: Update complete and verified
**Impact**: Orchestrators now have explicit composition patterns and understand the skill-invocation pattern for gate-based workflows

## [2026-01-06] Agent-Dispatch Pattern Update

### RED Phase Documentation

**Gap Identified**: The initial skill composition update used skill-invocation pattern (Read tool) for ALL phases. However, Phases 5-6 (Implementation, Testing) should spawn specialized agents (capability-developer, capability-tester) who have domain expertise in Go/fingerprintx.

**Test scenario**: Orchestrator tries to implement fingerprintx plugin by reading library skill → Orchestrator lacks specialized Go knowledge that capability-developer agent has.

**Expected improvement**: Agent-dispatch for implementation/testing leverages specialized agent knowledge and embeds mandatory skills in prompts for accountability.

### Changes Applied

1. **Updated Phases 5-6 to Agent-Dispatch Pattern**
   - Phase 5: Now spawns `capability-developer` agent (was: Read writing-fingerprintx-modules)
   - Phase 6: Now spawns `capability-tester` agent (was: Read writing-fingerprintx-tests)
   - Each phase references prompt template with mandatory skills embedded

2. **Created Agent Prompt Templates**
   - `references/prompts/developer-prompt.md` (3.2 KB) - For Phase 5 capability-developer
   - `references/prompts/tester-prompt.md` (3.6 KB) - For Phase 6 capability-tester
   - Each includes: context placeholders, OUTPUT_DIRECTORY, mandatory skills, JSON output format, blocked status handling

3. **Updated Integration Section**
   - Split "Calls" into "Calls (skill-invocation)" and "Spawns (agent-dispatch)"
   - Added new "Spawns" table showing which agents are spawned with mandatory skills
   - Updated Prompt Templates subsection with template table

4. **Updated references/prompts/README.md**
   - Documents the **hybrid pattern**: skill-invocation for research, agent-dispatch for implementation
   - Explains when each pattern is appropriate
   - Shows spawning examples for each agent type
   - Documents gate checklists for skill-invocation phases

### Hybrid Pattern Explained

| Pattern | Phases | Why This Pattern |
|---------|--------|------------------|
| Skill-Invocation | 3, 4, 7.4 | Research requires orchestrator judgment for gate decisions |
| Agent-Dispatch | 5, 6 | Implementation/Testing benefit from specialized agent expertise |

### GREEN Phase Verification

✅ Line count: 489/500 lines (reduced from 500 due to consolidation)
✅ Phase 5: Now spawns capability-developer with prompt template
✅ Phase 6: Now spawns capability-tester with prompt template
✅ Integration section: Updated with "Calls" vs "Spawns" distinction
✅ Prompt templates: 3 files (README.md, developer-prompt.md, tester-prompt.md)
✅ Mandatory skills: Embedded in each agent prompt template

### Skill Metadata Update

- **Line Count**: 489/500 lines (was 500)
- **Pattern**: Hybrid (skill-invocation + agent-dispatch)
- **Prompt Templates**: 3 files totaling ~11 KB
- **Agents Spawned**: capability-developer (Phase 5), capability-tester (Phase 6)

### Impact

- **Phases 5-6** now leverage specialized agent expertise
- **Mandatory skills** are embedded in prompts, ensuring agents invoke them
- **Research phases** remain skill-invocation for orchestrator-controlled gate decisions
- **Consistent with other orchestration skills** that use agent-dispatch for implementation/testing

**Status**: Update complete
**Impact**: Fingerprintx orchestrator now correctly uses hybrid pattern with agent-dispatch for implementation/testing
