# Changelog - windows-internals

## 2026-01-09 - Initial Creation

**Type**: Library/Framework skill
**Category**: security/windows
**Location**: `.claude/skill-library/security/windows/windows-internals/`

**RED Phase Documentation**:

**Gap**: When users ask deep technical questions about Windows kernel internals, process/thread management, memory management, I/O system, or low-level security mechanisms, Claude:
- Relies on training data that may be outdated or incomplete
- Cannot reference specific chapters, diagrams, or technical details from Windows Internals 7th Edition
- Misses implementation-specific details crucial for security research and tool development
- Cannot provide authoritative citations from the canonical Windows internals reference

**Test Scenario**: User asks "How does Windows implement process creation at the kernel level? Walk me through the CreateProcess stages."

**Expected Behavior**: Claude reads `Winternals7thPt1/chapters/chapter-03.md`, references the "Flow of CreateProcess" section with the 7-stage breakdown (validation, image opening, process object creation, thread initialization, subsystem initialization, thread startup, process initialization), and cites Windows Internals 7th Edition.

**GREEN Phase**: TBD - Will verify skill provides access to chapter content and enables accurate technical responses.

**Book Details**:
- Authors: Mark E. Russinovich, David A. Solomon, Alex Ionescu, Pavel Yosifovich
- Edition: 7th Edition, Part 1 (2017)
- Publisher: Microsoft Press
- Coverage: Windows 10 and Windows Server 2016
- Chapters: 0-7 (Front matter, Concepts/tools, System architecture, Processes/jobs, Threads, Memory management, I/O system, Security)

**Content Source**: OCR-transcribed markdown chapters in `Winternals7thPt1/chapters/` with automated error corrections applied (48 patterns fixed).

**Related Skills**:
- `windows-security-internals` - Complements Chapter 7 with deeper authentication/authorization coverage
- `evading-edr` - Applies Windows Internals concepts to EDR evasion techniques

## 2026-01-09 - GREEN Phase Verified

**Test Scenario**: User asks "How does Windows implement process creation at the kernel level? Walk me through the CreateProcess stages."

**Result**: SUCCESS ✅
- Skill successfully routes to `Winternals7thPt1/chapters/chapter-03.md`
- Chapter contains complete 7-stage CreateProcess flow (validation, image opening, process object creation, thread initialization, subsystem initialization, thread startup, process initialization)
- Authoritative technical details accessible with proper citation

**Gateway Integration**: Added to `gateway-security` with triggers "Windows internals", "kernel", "CreateProcess"

## 2026-01-09 - REFACTOR Phase Complete

**Pressure Test Approach**: Library/Framework reference skills (passive documentation) - sanity checks performed instead of active pressure testing.

**Mitigation Verified**:
- Clear "When to Use" sections guide appropriate skill invocation
- Gateway integration ensures automatic routing for Windows questions
- Chapter navigation and search patterns enable rapid topic lookup
- Integration section documents skill relationships

**Result**: Skills provide reliable access to authoritative Windows technical content.

## 2026-01-09 - Chapter Files Relocated

**Change**: Copied all chapter files from repository root to `references/chapters/` within skill directory for self-contained version control.

**Before**: Chapters referenced from `{repo-root}/Winternals7thPt1/chapters/`
**After**: Chapters included in `references/chapters/` (8 files: chapter-00.md through chapter-07.md)

**Updated Paths**:
- Read paths: `.claude/skill-library/security/windows/windows-internals/references/chapters/chapter-0N.md`
- Grep paths: `.claude/skill-library/security/windows/windows-internals/references/chapters/*.md`

**Rationale**: Makes skill self-contained and suitable for version control without depending on repo root directories.
