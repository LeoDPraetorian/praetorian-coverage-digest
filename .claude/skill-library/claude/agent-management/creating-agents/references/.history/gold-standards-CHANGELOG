# Changelog - gold-standards.md

## 2025-12-29

### Changed
- **CRITICAL FIX**: Completely rewritten to document ACTUAL patterns from gold standard agents
- Changed from single gold standard (frontend-developer) to four exemplars (frontend-lead, frontend-tester, security-lead, frontend-developer)
- Corrected Skill Loading Protocol from "Tier 1/2/3" to "Step 1/2/3"
- Fixed two-tier skill system documentation (was "Read() for all skills", now correctly "Skill tool for core, Read for library")
- Corrected output format from single "skills_read" array to "skills_invoked" + "library_skills_read"
- Fixed Anti-Bypass guidance from "3 brief points" to "5-6 detailed points with explanations"
- Updated line count targets to realistic ranges (150-280 lines by type, not universal <150)
- Added comprehensive anti-patterns section calling out incorrect claims
- Added concrete examples FROM actual gold standard agent files (with line numbers)

### Why
The reference file had DRIFTED and contained FACTUALLY INCORRECT information:
- Claimed "Use Read() for ALL skills (not Skill tool)" - COMPLETELY WRONG
- Showed single "skills_read" array - WRONG (actual is two arrays)
- Said "Brief Anti-Bypass (3 points, no aggressive language)" - WRONG (actual is 5-6 detailed)
- Referenced only "frontend-developer (129 lines)" as gold standard - outdated/incomplete
- Used "Tiered Skill Loading Protocol" terminology - WRONG (actual uses "Step 1/2/3")

This caused developers to create agents that don't match the actual gold standard pattern.

### Impact
- Documentation now matches reality
- Developers will understand the two-tier skill system correctly
- Anti-patterns section prevents repeating incorrect patterns
- Examples are cited from actual agent files with line numbers for verification

### Line Count
- Before: 457 lines
- After: 516 lines (+59 lines of correct documentation)

### Verification
All claims in this file are now verifiable against the actual agent files:
- frontend-lead.md (151 lines)
- frontend-tester.md (277 lines)
- security-lead.md (185 lines)
- frontend-developer.md (160 lines)
