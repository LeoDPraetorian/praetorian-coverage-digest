# Changelog - hypercube-browser-extension

## 2026-01-08 - Description Enhancement (Audit Fix)

### Changed
- **Enhanced description for completeness and discoverability** (auditing-skills workflow)
  - Added missing capabilities: "Firebase deployment", "extension customization", "website generation", "testing", "operational security"
  - Improved searchability: Added "C2 framework" and "red team engagements" industry terms
  - Length: 244 characters (within acceptable range, improved comprehensiveness)

### Removed
- Generic terms: "exploitation framework" → "C2 framework" (more specific)
- Generic terms: "authorized security testing" → "authorized red team engagements" (more discoverable)

### Rationale
- **Completeness**: Original description missed 3 major phases (website, testing, opsec) representing ~40% of workflow content
- **Discoverability**: Users searching for "red team browser extension" or "pentest C2" now find this skill more easily
- **Accuracy maintained**: All described capabilities are present in the skill

### Audit Results
- Phase 1 (Description Format): ⚠️ WARNING → ✅ PASS
- Semantic Review (Completeness): ⚠️ WARNING → ✅ PASS
- Semantic Review (Discoverability): ℹ️ INFO → ✅ PASS

## 2026-01-08 - Website Generation Phase Added

### Added
- **New Phase 5: Generate Professional Website (Credibility Multiplier)**
  - Complete 9-page website structure (homepage, portal, features, about, support, privacy, terms, download, styles)
  - Reference documentation: `references/website-generation.md` (91 lines)
  - Deployment options: GitHub Pages, Netlify, Vercel, Firebase Hosting
  - Chrome Store integration fields (website URL, privacy policy URL, support URL)

- **Demo Functionality Rules**:
  - Show realistic error messages ("Invalid email or password") instead of "demo mode" alerts
  - Simulate loading states with button text changes and delays
  - Styled error notifications matching real authentication failures
  - Contact forms show "service temporarily unavailable" errors

- **Link Policy (Critical OpSec)**:
  - All links must point to site itself only (no external links)
  - No social media links in footer (creates verification surface)
  - No Chrome Web Store direct links (use internal download page)
  - No third-party integrations or backstops

### Changed
- Renumbered subsequent phases: old Phase 5 → Phase 6, old Phase 6 → Phase 7
- Updated sub-section numbering throughout (5.1-5.3 → 6.1-6.3, 7.1-7.3 unchanged)

### Rationale
- Professional website increases extension credibility dramatically (appears as established company vs throwaway project)
- Users researching extension find substantial online presence with customer portal, legal pages, support
- Internal-only links prevent verification failures (broken social media, non-existent Chrome Store listings during testing)
- Realistic error messages maintain illusion of real service without backend implementation
- Website is easily rebrandable (10-15 minutes) for future engagements

### Verification
- GREEN: PASS (website generated and tested with convincing demo functionality)
- Compliance: PENDING (line count check needed)
- No external links present in generated website
- Demo modes show authentication failures, not "demo mode" alerts

## 2026-01-07 - Workflow Reorganization + OpSec Improvements

### Changed
- **Reorganized workflow phases** to reflect correct order:
  - Phase 1: Design Pretext (conceptual)
  - Phase 2: Deploy Infrastructure (hypercube-deployer agent automation)
  - Phase 3: Dress/Customize Extension (make it unique)
  - Phase 4: Chrome Web Store Materials  
  - Phase 5: Testing & Validation
  - Phase 6: Operational Guidance

- **Added hypercube-deployer agent** as primary automation path
  - Automates Firebase setup, WASM build, credential embedding
  - Output location documented: `.claude/.output/agents/[timestamp]-hypercube-deployment/`

- **Added OpSec improvements**:
  - Phase 3.1: WASM file renaming (main.wasm → pretext-appropriate name like api-validator.wasm, license-check.wasm)
  - Updated background.js to load renamed WASM file
  - Examples: DevAPI Tester Pro (api-validator.wasm), Antiphish Solutions (threat-detector.wasm)

- **Added CSP compliance requirements** in Phase 3.2:
  - NO inline JavaScript allowed in popup.html
  - All JS must be in separate .js files
  - No inline event handlers (onclick, etc.)
  - Use addEventListener for all interactivity

### Removed
- **Incorrect Firebase reuse warning** - Firebase projects can be reused across engagements
- **Redundant instrumentation phase** - hypercube-deployer handles this automatically

### Added
- DevAPI Tester Pro example reference (developer tools pretext)
- Phase numbering now reflects actual deployment sequence

### Rationale
- Previous workflow had manual Firebase setup before pretext design, which was backwards
- Automation via hypercube-deployer makes deployment faster and more reliable
- OpSec improvements (WASM renaming, visual distinctness) are critical for operational security
- CSP compliance is mandatory for Chrome Store approval
