## [Initial Creation] - 2026-01-07

### Added

- Initial skill structure for mapping security findings to CIS Benchmarks
- Category: frameworks (library skill)
- Skill type: Library/Framework
- Coverage for AWS, Azure, GCP, Linux, Windows, Kubernetes, Docker platforms
- CIS profile levels (Level 1, Level 2, STIG)
- Scoring methodology (Pass/Fail/Not Applicable)
- Integration guidance for VQL capabilities and Nuclei templates
- Control mapping methodology with 4-step process

### RED Phase Documentation

**Gap identified**: When asked "Which CIS Benchmark control applies to this S3 bucket misconfiguration?", Claude provides generic security advice without:

- Specific CIS control IDs (e.g., CIS AWS 2.1.1)
- Profile level classification (Level 1/Level 2/STIG)
- Scoring criteria (Pass/Fail/Not Applicable)
- Platform-specific benchmark references
- Systematic mapping methodology

**Test scenario**: "I have a VQL capability that detects publicly accessible S3 buckets. Which CIS Benchmark control should I reference in the finding?"

**Expected behavior**: Without this skill, Claude lacks structured guidance for mapping findings to CIS control IDs, profile levels, and remediation references.

### Structure

- Main SKILL.md: 242 lines (under 500 line limit)
- References directory: Prepared for detailed content
- Examples directory: Prepared for mapping examples
- Integration section: Documents standalone nature and optional framework pairing
