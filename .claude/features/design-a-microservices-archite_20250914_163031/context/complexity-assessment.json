  "justification": "This is a complex undertaking that fundamentally transforms the architecture from a serverless monolith to distributed microservices. The existing platform has 50+ Lambda handlers tightly coupled through shared DynamoDB tables and synchronous invocations. Decomposing this into 8-10 microservices requires careful service boundary definition, data consistency strategies, and comprehensive security implementation. The Janus framework provides orchestration capabilities but needs significant extension for microservices. The 4-6 month timeline accounts for gradual migration maintaining 99.9% availability, team training, and establishing new operational practices.",
