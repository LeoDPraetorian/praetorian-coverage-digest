## [Initial Creation] - 2026-01-03

### Added
- Initial skill creation for Bugcrowd integration
- RED Phase Documentation: Proves gap exists for comprehensive Bugcrowd integration patterns
  - Without skill: Generic REST API patterns, missing Bugcrowd-specific context
  - With skill: Authentication (API Key + OAuth), rate limiting, webhooks, data mapping
- Category: development/integrations/
- Skill Type: Integration (Chariot ↔ Bugcrowd bidirectional sync)
- Structure: SKILL.md (329 lines) with progressive disclosure using references/
- Core sections: Authentication, API Overview, Rate Limiting, Webhooks, Data Mapping, Security

### RED Phase Details
**Gap Identified:**
Chariot platform requires Bugcrowd integration for vulnerability synchronization from bug bounty programs. Without this skill:
- No standardized authentication patterns (API Key vs OAuth selection)
- Missing rate limiting and retry strategies specific to Bugcrowd
- No webhook validation patterns for real-time submission updates
- Lack of data mapping guidance (Bugcrowd submissions → Chariot vulnerabilities)
- No security best practices for bug bounty platform integrations

**Test Scenario (Pre-Skill):**
User: "Integrate Chariot with Bugcrowd API"
Claude: Provides generic REST API patterns, misses Bugcrowd submission workflows, webhook event types, researcher engagement patterns, bounty payment synchronization.

### Phase 6: Research & Population Complete
**Research Execution:** orchestrating-research with 12 parallel agents (Context7 + Perplexity)
- Total research output: 7,311 lines across 12 documents
- Synthesis document: SYNTHESIS.md (732 lines)
- Reference files created: 6 comprehensive guides

**Reference Files Populated:**
1. authentication-patterns.md - Bearer tokens, IP allowlisting, multi-token strategy
2. webhook-handling.md - HMAC validation, idempotency, async processing
3. data-mapping.md - VRT→Chariot mapping, CWE lookup, transformation examples
4. rate-limiting-strategies.md - Token bucket, Redis implementation, exponential backoff
5. security-best-practices.md - Defense-in-depth, PII protection, GDPR compliance
6. error-handling.md - Circuit breakers, retry logic, graceful degradation, api-reference.md - Core endpoints, pagination, response formats

**Key Research Findings:**
- Bugcrowd rate limit: 60 req/min per IP (NOT per token)
- Authentication: Bearer Token with header `Authorization: Token {token}`
- Webhooks: At-least-once delivery, HMAC-SHA256 signatures, 30s timeout
- CWE mapping: Sparse coverage (many VRT categories unmapped)
- Security: 9-domain defense-in-depth with GDPR compliance requirements

### Notes
- Gateway update required (gateway-integrations routing table) - Phase 7
- GREEN phase pending - Phase 8
- REFACTOR/pressure testing pending - Phase 9
