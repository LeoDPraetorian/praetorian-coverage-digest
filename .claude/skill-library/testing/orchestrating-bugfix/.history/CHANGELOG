# Changelog

All notable changes to orchestrating-bugfix skill.

Format: ISO-8601 date, change type, description, context

## 2026-01-15 - Initial Creation

**Type:** create
**Category:** development/
**Skill Type:** Process/Pattern

**Context (RED Phase Documentation):**

**Why this skill is needed:**
Bug fixing currently requires orchestrating-feature-development, which includes unnecessary phases (brainstorming, architecture planning, multi-task implementation) that don't apply to bug fixes. Bugs need investigation and minimal fixes, not full feature development ceremony.

**Current failure behavior:**
When users say "fix this bug," Claude either:
1. Uses orchestrating-feature-development (wasteful - 2-4 hours for a 20-40 minute task)
2. Attempts ad-hoc fixes without systematic debugging (missing root cause analysis)
3. Skips TDD or verification steps (introduces regressions)

**The gap:**
No lightweight orchestration exists that coordinates:
- Discovery (0-5 Explore agents, not 1-10)
- Debugging (systematic root cause analysis)
- TDD implementation (test-first minimal fix)
- Verification (regression checking)

Without human checkpoints for brainstorming/architecture, focusing only on the investigation→fix→verify cycle.

**Created:**
- SKILL.md (265 lines - well under 500 line limit)
- Directory structure with references/ and examples/
- Integrated with discovering-bugs-for-fixing library skill
- 5-phase workflow: Setup → Scoping → Investigation → Implementation → Verification

## 2026-01-15 - Phase 8 Compliance Fixes

**Type:** update

**Changes:**
- Fixed description format (now starts with "Use when")
- Shortened description from 209 chars to 112 chars (< 120 limit)
- Ran prettier to format all tables
- Added to gateway-testing routing tables
- Created 5 reference files with substantial content:
  - phase-0-setup.md (141 lines)
  - phase-1-2-scoping-discovery.md (214 lines)
  - phase-3-investigation.md (312 lines)
  - phase-4-implementation.md (338 lines)
  - phase-5-verification.md (387 lines)

**GREEN Verification:** User confirmed skill successfully addresses gap from RED phase
