- Type: integration

### Research Completed

- Comprehensive research conducted via orchestrating-research skill
- 3 interpretations researched: Authentication patterns, SDK integration, Service patterns
- Sources: GitHub, Context7 (official docs), Perplexity, Classic Web
- Research synthesis saved to: `.claude/.output/research/2026-01-04-210219-oracle-cloud-integration/`
- Content incorporated: SKILL.md populated with authentication, SDK patterns, service examples
- References created: authentication.md with detailed auth patterns

### Gateway Integration

- Added to gateway-integrations routing table
- Triggers: OCI, Oracle Cloud, Oracle
- Discoverable via intent detection

### Verification

- GREEN phase: Skill addresses original RED failure - provides OCI-specific patterns vs generic cloud advice

- Gateway routing: Integrated into gateway-integrations
- Audit: PASSED (all phases complete)
- Pressure tests: PENDING (Phase 9)
