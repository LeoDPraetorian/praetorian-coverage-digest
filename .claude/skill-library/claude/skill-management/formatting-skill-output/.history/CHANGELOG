## [2025-12-26] - Initial Creation

**RED Failure Documentation:**
Multiple skills (auditing-skills, finding-agents-for-skills) need Claude to output structured results (tables). But Claude's text generation is inherently non-deterministic - same instructions produce different formatting, prose, spacing each run. User observed audit semantic review outputting "horrible format that will be non-deterministic." Known issue: anthropics/claude-code#3370.

**Category:** Library (claude/skill-management/)
**Skill Type:** Infrastructure/Library (shared TypeScript library)

**What this skill provides:**
- Shared `table-formatter.ts` library for deterministic ANSI table output
- JSON schemas for semantic findings, agent recommendations
- CLI entry point for standalone formatting
- Pattern documentation: "Claude Reasons, CLI Formats"

**Consumer skills:**
- auditing-skills - semantic review findings
- finding-agents-for-skills - agent recommendations
- syncing-gateways - gateway sync results

**Key principle:** Same input → Same output, ALWAYS.
