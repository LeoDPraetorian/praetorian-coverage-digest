## [2026-01-10] - Requirements Verification Added

### Changed
- **Step 1**: Expanded from "Verify Tests" to "Verify Tests AND Requirements"
  - Added 1a (Verify Tests Pass) - original test verification
  - Added 1b (Verify Requirements/Exit Criteria Met) - new requirements verification
  - Agents must now verify BOTH tests pass AND requirements met before proceeding
  - Added guidance for plan-based work (read exit criteria, verify each criterion, count completions)
  - Added guidance for work without formal plans (ask user for requirements)

### Added
- **Common Mistakes**: "Assuming tests = requirements" entry
  - Problem: Tests pass but exit criteria not met (e.g., 47 files updated instead of 118)
  - Fix: Verify requirements/exit criteria separately from test verification

- **Red Flags**: Added requirements verification mandates
  - Never: "Assume passing tests means requirements are met"
  - Never: "Skip requirements verification for 'obvious' completions"
  - Never: "Proceed if ANY exit criterion is unverified"
  - Always: "Verify requirements/exit criteria separately from tests"

### Why
Prevents false completion claims where tests pass but actual work requirements incomplete.
Example: Agent updates 47 files instead of 118, tests pass, agent proceeds to merge/PR options.

### Testing
RED: Scenario where agent proceeds to Step 2 with passing tests but incomplete requirements
GREEN: Agent now stops at Step 1b, reports incomplete requirements, blocks Step 2
