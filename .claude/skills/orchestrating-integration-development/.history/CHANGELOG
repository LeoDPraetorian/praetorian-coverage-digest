# Changelog

All notable changes to the orchestrating-integration-development skill.

## [2026-01-14] - P0 Requirement Description Alignment

### Changed
- Updated CheckAffiliation requirement descriptions to reference Pattern A/B/C instead of 'external API query' (aligns with developing-integrations 2026-01-14 update)
- Updated Pagination requirement descriptions to allow 'maxPages OR API signal' instead of mandating 'maxPages constant' (aligns with developing-integrations 2026-01-14 update)

### Fixed
- Inconsistency between orchestrating-integration-development SKILL.md and developing-integrations library skill P0 patterns
- Phase 3 Design section (lines 285-286) now correctly references flexible patterns
- Phase 4.5 P0 Requirements table (lines 360, 363) now matches authoritative source
- Phase 4.5 Gate Checklist (lines 377, 380) now matches authoritative source
- Exit Criteria section (lines 853, 856) now matches authoritative source

### Files Modified
- SKILL.md (8 inline edits across 6 locations)

### Context
The developing-integrations library skill was updated 2026-01-14 to support:
- CheckAffiliation Pattern A (direct API query), Pattern B (CheckAffiliationSimple), Pattern C (seed-based)
- Pagination: maxPages constant OR API-provided signals (LastPage, HasMore, NextToken)

This update ensures orchestrating-integration-development references match the flexible patterns now accepted by the authoritative source.

### Changed
- **Description Enhancement** (Semantic Review - Discoverability):
  - Added specific P0 requirement names to description for better search discoverability
  - Old: "...P0 compliance validation"
  - New: "...P0 compliance validation (VMFilter, CheckAffiliation, ValidateCredentials, errgroup, pagination patterns)"
  - Description now 243 chars (>120 warning threshold but justified for comprehensive scope)

- Removed TODO comment about pending prompt template creation (line 600)

- **Phase 26 (Reference Content Quality)**: All reference files have substantive content (93-610 lines each)
- **Phase 13 (State Externalization)**: Added explicit TodoWrite mandate
- **Semantic Review**: Enhanced description specificity and discoverability

### Verification
- All reference files >50 lines minimum (verified)
- All broken links now resolve (verified)
- Description includes P0 terminology (verified)
- TodoWrite mandate present (verified)

### Method
- **Deterministic**: None (no mechanical transformations)
- **Claude-Automated**: All fixes (Phase 1, 4, 13, 26)
- **Hybrid**: None required
- **Human-Required**: None required

## [2025-01-14] - Phase 7 Decision Criteria

### Added
- Explicit decision criteria table for Phase 7 (Frontend Integration)
- Decision protocol with 4-step evaluation process
- Phase 7 Decision Checkpoint in workflow diagram between Phase 6 and Phase 7
- Frontend Requirements section requirement in Phase 3 gate checklist
- metadata.json schema documentation for Phase 7 skip/execute tracking
- New reference file: `references/phase-7-frontend-integration.md` with:
  - "When to Run This Phase" section
  - Decision criteria table with 5 patterns
  - Decision protocol pseudocode
  - Metadata tracking examples
  - Common patterns (API key, OAuth2, service account, seed-based)

### Changed
- Phase 7 section: Replaced vague "Trigger: Only if integration needs UI configuration" with explicit decision criteria and protocol
- Quick Reference table: Updated Phase 7 Human Checkpoint from "-" to "Decision checkpoint (see criteria)"
- Phase 3 gate checklist: Added Frontend Requirements verification (Needs UI: YES/NO, reason, enum/logo/config if YES)
- Phase 7 gate checklist: Added decision evaluation step and metadata.json skip documentation requirement

### Problem Fixed
Phase 7 decision was subjective and inconsistent. No specification of:
- WHO decides if Phase 7 runs (Answer: integration-lead in Phase 3)
- WHAT criteria to evaluate (Answer: 5 criteria in decision table)
- WHEN decision is made (Answer: Phase 3 documents, Phase 6→7 transition executes)
- HOW decision is tracked (Answer: metadata.json with skip_reason or files_created)

Result: Phase 7 execution is now deterministic based on architecture.md "Frontend Requirements" section.
