## 2025-12-29 - Initial Creation

**RED Phase Documentation:**

**Gap Identified**: When porting Python projects to Go (garak → Venator), no established workflow for verifying Go implementations match Python behavior.

**Test Without Skill**: Built equivalence framework from scratch, encountered:
1. Architecture mismatch (Go under Rosetta x86_64, Python packages arm64)
2. Value mismatches (primary_detector, prompts count, goal strings)
3. No documented patterns for subprocess wrapper, float epsilon, macOS detection

**Verbatim Failure**: Initial tests 12/16 passing, 4 probe tests failing due to architecture. After arch fix, semantic differences required updating Go to match Python.

**Why Needed**: Future ports (325 remaining capabilities) will need this verification workflow.

**Category**: development/capabilities

**Skill Type**: Process/Pattern - Methodology for equivalence verification

**Location**: Library (.claude/skill-library/development/capabilities/)

**Line Count**: 337 lines (target <500)
