**RED Phase Documentation:**

**Gap**: The mcp-tool-reviewer agent contains 100+ lines of review methodology embedded in the agent definition (lines 127-231). This violates the agent architecture principle of "agents = executors, skills = knowledge".

**Current Failure**: mcp-tool-reviewer must parse embedded instructions from its own definition rather than loading a dedicated skill. This:
- Bloats the agent definition
- Makes methodology harder to maintain and update
- Prevents reuse by other contexts
- Violates skill-agent separation pattern

**Expected Behavior**: mcp-tool-reviewer should load reviewing-mcp-wrappers skill for HOW-to methodology.

**Category**: mcp-management (library)
**Skill Type**: Process/Pattern
**Line Count**: 196 lines (target <500)
