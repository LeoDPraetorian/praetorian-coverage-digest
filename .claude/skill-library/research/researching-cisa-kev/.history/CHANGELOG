# Changelog: researching-cisa-kev

## 2026-01-08 - Initial Creation

**Type:** Library skill creation
**Category:** research
**Skill Type:** Process/Pattern (research methodology)

### RED Phase Documentation

**Gap:** CISA KEV catalog is authoritative source for confirmed exploited CVEs. No structured methodology existed for querying, extracting, and synthesizing KEV data for security capability development and vulnerability prioritization.

**Failure Scenario (Without Skill):**
- User request: "Research Apache vulnerabilities in CISA KEV"
- Claude manually constructs URLs without standardized patterns
- Ad-hoc WebFetch without structured data extraction
- Misses critical fields (remediation deadline, exploitation notes, federal due dates)
- No consistent output format
- Cannot integrate with orchestrating-research

**Success Criteria:**
- 5-phase methodology (Query Formulation → Search Execution → Vulnerability Analysis → Synthesis → Recommendation)
- Standardized query patterns by vendor/product/CVE/vulnerability class
- Complete KEV data extraction (CVE ID, vendor, product, date added, due date, required action, notes)
- Integration with orchestrating-research (Mode 1: standalone, Mode 2: orchestrated)
- Remediation priority matrix by federal deadline

### Structure

**Location:** `.claude/skill-library/research/researching-cisa-kev/`
**Line Count:** 418 lines (under 500 limit)
**Model:** Based on researching-arxiv structure

### Phase Summary

1. Query Formulation - Vendor/product/CVE/vulnerability class search strategies
2. Search Execution - CISA KEV URL construction, date filtering, pagination
3. Vulnerability Analysis - Extract all 9 KEV fields, prioritize by due date/relevance
4. Synthesis - Remediation priority matrix, exploitation context, threat actors
5. Recommendation - Detection/capability guidance, patch prioritization

### Key Features

- **CISA KEV-specific:** Tailored to KEV catalog structure (not generic CVE search)
- **Federal deadline focus:** Prioritization by FCEB remediation due dates
- **Exploitation confirmation:** Every entry represents active real-world exploitation
- **Dual-mode output:** Standalone (timestamped directory) or orchestrated (OUTPUT_DIR)
- **Detection integration:** Guides capability development with threat context

### References Created

- `references/query-patterns.md` - Vendor/product search strategies (populated from specs)
- `references/remediation-analysis.md` - Due dates and federal deadlines (populated from specs)
- `references/output-format.md` - Structured output templates (populated from specs)

**Research Decision:** Skipped orchestrating-research, populated from user-provided specifications per user choice.

### Gateway Integration

Added to `gateway-capabilities`:
- **Intent Detection:** "CISA KEV" / "known exploited" / "exploited vulnerability" / "CVE research"
- **Skill Registry:** Under Fingerprintx section with other research skills

### Completed Phases

- [x] Phase 6: Research and populate reference files (populated from specs)
- [x] Phase 7: Add to gateway-capabilities routing table
- [x] Phase 8: GREEN verification (tested with Apache CISA KEV query - successful)
- [x] Phase 9: REFACTOR - Skipped (research methodology skill, no discipline to enforce)

### GREEN Verification Results

**Test:** Query CISA KEV catalog for Apache vulnerabilities
**URL:** `https://www.cisa.gov/known-exploited-vulnerabilities-catalog?search_api_fulltext=apache&...`
**Result:** Successfully extracted 5 CVEs with all required fields:
- CVE-2024-38475 (Apache HTTP Server RCE)
- CVE-2025-24813 (Apache Tomcat RCE)
- CVE-2017-3066 (Adobe ColdFusion/BlazeDS RCE)
- CVE-2024-45195 (Apache OFBiz Forced Browsing)
- CVE-2024-27348 (Apache HugeGraph RCE)

### Skill Complete

**Status:** Ready for use
**Created:** 2026-01-08
