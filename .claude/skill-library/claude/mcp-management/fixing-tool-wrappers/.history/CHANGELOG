# Changelog: fixing-tool-wrappers

## 2026-01-17 - Initial Creation

**Type:** Library skill (Process/Pattern)
**Category:** claude/mcp-management
**Location:** `.claude/skill-library/claude/mcp-management/fixing-tool-wrappers/`

**RED Phase Documentation:**

**Gap identified:** No dedicated skill for MCP tool wrapper fix operations. The `managing-tool-wrappers` core skill routes fix operations, but there's no library skill documenting:
- Which compliance phases can be auto-fixed vs manual
- Commands for preview (--dry-run) and apply modes
- Special handling for Phase 12 (Service Metadata) requiring user input
- The audit → preview → fix → verify workflow

**Failure scenario:** User asks "How do I fix Phase 2 compliance issues in my tool wrapper?"

**Agent behavior WITHOUT skill (verbatim from agent afb1075):**
- "Without knowing the specific Phase 2 issues, I would NOT suggest specific fix commands yet"
- "I would NOT mention preview vs apply modes unless I found evidence in the documentation"
- Multi-step manual investigation (grep through multiple files, read docs, then maybe suggest)
- No awareness of fix command automation or workflow

**Created:** 450-line SKILL.md with:
- Quick reference table mapping phases to fix capabilities
- Auto-fixable phases (2, 4, 11) with commands
- Partial auto-fix workflow for Phase 12 (interactive description prompt)
- Manual fix guidance for phases 1, 3, 5-10
- Preview --dry-run as mandatory step
- Complete audit → preview → fix → verify workflow

**Integration:** Routes from `managing-tool-wrappers`, calls `auditing-tool-wrappers`

**Next:** Phase 6 (Research), Phase 7 (Gateway update), Phase 8 (GREEN), Phase 9 (REFACTOR)
