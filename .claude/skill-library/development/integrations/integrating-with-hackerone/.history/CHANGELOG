### 2024-2025 API Timeline Documented
- **March 2024:** Hacktivity API for hackers
- **May 2024:** Asset Tagging with API support

### Key Research Findings
- ✅ No API v2 exists - HackerOne evolves v1 with backward compatibility
- ✅ No GraphQL API - REST only
- ✅ Webhooks require Professional tier (as of January 2025)
- ✅ Incremental activities endpoint is critical for production (10-100x more efficient)
- ✅ Rate limits updated October 2023 (report pages: 600→300 req/min)
- ✅ CVSS 4.0 support added January 2025 (backward compatible with 3.1)

### Files Modified
