## 2025-12-31 - Initial Creation

**Phase**: 🔴 RED

**Gap Documented**:
Fingerprintx service detection plugins frequently lack comprehensive unit tests. Without systematic testing guidance, developers:
- Write integration tests requiring live services instead of unit tests
- Skip edge cases (truncated data, malformed input, wrong types)
- Don't test protocol parsing functions (BSON, binary protocols)
- Miss response validation and message building tests
- Create inconsistent test patterns across plugins

**Failure Behavior (Without Skill)**:
When asked "Write unit tests for a fingerprintx plugin", Claude:
- Creates integration tests requiring real services
- Misses critical edge cases (empty documents, wrong types, truncated data)
- Doesn't follow established table-driven test patterns from mysql_test.go, postgresql_test.go
- Skips protocol-specific parsing function tests
- Doesn't provide guidance on mock response construction

**Evidence**: User stated "Many existing plugins lack tests" - proves need for skill to ensure comprehensive test coverage following established patterns.

**Category**: development/capabilities/
**Location**: Library (fingerprintx-specific domain knowledge)
**Skill Type**: Process/Pattern

**Created Files**:
- SKILL.md (272 lines - well under 500 limit)
- references/parsing-tests.md - BSON and binary protocol parsing patterns
- references/response-validation-tests.md - Protocol response verification (OP_REPLY, OP_MSG)
- references/message-building-tests.md - Wire protocol message construction
- references/mock-construction.md - Building realistic test responses without live services

**Integration**: Phase 4 of fingerprintx development workflow:
1. researching-protocols - Research protocol specification
2. researching-version-markers - Identify version detection markers
3. writing-nerva-tcp-udp-modules - Implement the plugin
4. writing-fingerprintx-tests - Write comprehensive tests (THIS SKILL)

**Next Steps**:
- Phase 6: Research (examine reference test files in fingerprintx codebase)
- Phase 7: Update gateway-capabilities routing table
- Phase 8: GREEN verification
- Phase 9: REFACTOR with pressure testing
