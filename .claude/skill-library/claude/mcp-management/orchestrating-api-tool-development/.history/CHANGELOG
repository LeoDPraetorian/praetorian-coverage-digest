## 2026-01-04 - Initial Creation

**RED Phase:**
- Gap: No orchestration skill for REST API wrapper development
- Test scenario: Ask Claude to "create a VirusTotal API wrapper" without skill → Claude wouldn't know to use http-client infrastructure, TDD workflow, or agent coordination
- Failure: Missing workflow documentation for REST API wrappers (MCP has orchestrating-mcp-development, REST APIs have none)

**Location:** .claude/skill-library/claude/mcp-management/orchestrating-api-tool-development/
**Category:** claude/mcp-management
**Type:** Process/Pattern (orchestration workflow)

**Context:**
- REST API wrapper infrastructure exists at .claude/tools/config/lib/http-client.ts
- Shodan reference implementation complete (.claude/tools/shodan/ with 51 passing tests)
- Architecture documented at .claude/.output/api-wrappers/http-client-architecture.md

**Rationale:**
Parallel to orchestrating-mcp-development but for REST APIs. Guides TDD workflow (RED-GREEN-REFACTOR), agent coordination (tool-tester → tool-developer → tool-reviewer), and token optimization patterns.
