## 2026-01-06 - Pressure Testing (REFACTOR Phase)

**Pressure tests run:**
1. Time pressure: PASS - Agent selected CWE-732, rejected "just ship it"
2. Authority pressure: PARTIAL FAIL - Agent deferred to lead approval of CWE-284
3. Sunk cost pressure: PASS - Agent identified CWE-798, rejected sunk cost arguments

**Loophole closed:**
- Added "Deferring to Team Standard for Pillar CWEs" section
- Counter-rationalization: Authority doesn't override technical correctness

## 2026-01-05 - Initial Creation

**Category:** frameworks (library skill)
**Type:** Library/Framework

### RED Phase Documentation
- **Gap:** Capability developers understand vulnerabilities but lack CWE taxonomy mapping knowledge
- **Test Scenario:** "I'm writing a capability that detects publicly accessible S3 buckets. Which CWE should I use?"
- **Failure Without Skill:** Generic advice to "check MITRE CWE", missing distinction between CWE-284 vs CWE-732, no decision trees

### Initial Structure
- SKILL.md: 243 lines (progressive disclosure)
- Quick lookup tables for cloud, network, web, credentials domains
- CWE taxonomy hierarchy explanation
- Decision trees for access control, cryptography, credentials
- Common mistakes section
- References placeholder for research-populated content

### Pending
- Research phase to populate references/ with comprehensive CWE data
- Gateway update for routing
- GREEN/REFACTOR phases
