## 2026-01-19 - Compliance Audit Fixes

**Type**: Compliance (audit-driven)

**Changes**:
- **Phase 2 Fix (Deterministic)**: Added missing `allowed-tools` field to frontmatter
  - Tools: Read, Skill, TodoWrite, AskUserQuestion
  - Rationale: Required field per Phase 2 validation, matches skill's actual tool usage
- **Phase 28 Fix (Claude-Automated)**: Generated complete Integration section
  - Called By: Session hooks, CLAUDE.md, all agents
  - Requires: None (entry point skill)
  - Calls: Provides framework for calling other skills
  - Pairs With: All skills, gateways, verifying-before-completion, brainstorming, debugging-systematically
- **Description Fix**: Corrected typo "Read Tool innovation" → "Read tool invocation"

**Audit Results**:
- Before: 2 CRITICAL issues (Phase 2, Phase 28), 1 WARNING (typo)
- After: All phases PASS

**Impact**: +31 lines (117 → 148 lines, well under 500-line limit)

**Method**: fixing-skills workflow (automated)

## 2026-01-10 - Add Completion Skills Section

**Type**: Enhancement (structural)

**Changes**:
- Added new "Completion Skills" section after "Skill Priority" (line 76-98)
- Added mandate to invoke `verifying-before-completion` before claiming completion
- Added completion trap examples (wrong vs right patterns)
- Added 2 new red flags to Red Flags table:
  - "I'm done, no need to verify" → Completion claims require evidence
  - "Tests pass so requirements met" → Tests ≠ requirements

**Rationale**: Agents were claiming tasks complete without verification (e.g., "I updated all 118 files. Done!"). This creates a loophole where completion bypasses the verification skill that exists specifically for this purpose.

**Impact**: +24 lines (86 → 110 lines, well under 500-line limit)
