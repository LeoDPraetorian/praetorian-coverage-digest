# Changelog: integrating-with-github

## 2026-01-03 - Initial Creation

**RED Phase Documentation:**

**Gap Identified:**
Claude currently struggles with GitHub integrations due to:
1. Authentication method selection - defaults to Personal Access Tokens instead of more secure GitHub Apps
2. Rate limiting - missing or naive implementation, no exponential backoff, doesn't handle secondary limits
3. API efficiency - uses REST API with multiple calls when GraphQL would be more efficient
4. Security patterns - hardcodes secrets, insufficient permission scopes, missing webhook validation
5. Self-hosted runners - complex security implications not documented
6. Comprehensive knowledge gap across all GitHub integration aspects

**Failure Behavior:**
Without this skill, Claude implements GitHub integrations that:
- Use less secure authentication (PAT instead of GitHub App with granular permissions)
- Implement naive retry logic without checking X-RateLimit-Remaining headers
- Make 20+ REST calls when a single GraphQL query would suffice
- Hardcode tokens instead of using secrets management
- Miss critical webhook signature validation (X-Hub-Signature-256)
- Expose self-hosted runners to security risks

**User Confirmation:**
User confirmed all failure patterns observed in production:
- Authentication - wrong method chosen (PAT vs OAuth vs GitHub App)
- Rate limiting - naive or missing retry logic
- API efficiency - uses REST when GraphQL would be better
- Comprehensive gap - all GitHub integration aspects
