### Current Enforcement Posture (January 2026)

**Pragmatic initial approach:**
- Regulators emphasizing **education over punishment**
- **Tolerance for documented remediation plans** ("action plan" defense)
- Focus on **systemic resilience** rather than individual penalties
- Early adopter leniency for good-faith efforts

**Expected evolution:**
- Transition to **stricter enforcement** as compliance matures
- Public enforcement actions for egregious non-compliance
- Industry-wide precedents set through initial cases

## Proportionality Principle

DORA applies proportionality based on:
- **Entity size** (microenterprises get limited exemptions)
- **Complexity** of operations
- **Nature** of services provided
- **Risk profile**

**Microenterprise exemptions** (Article 4):
- <10 employees AND <€2M annual turnover
- Exempt from some requirements (e.g., TLPT)
- Still must report major incidents under Article 19
- Simplified ICT risk management framework (Article 15)

**Scaled requirements for smaller entities:**
- Less frequent TLPT (if required at all)
- Simplified testing programs
- Proportionate third-party risk management
- Streamlined reporting formats
