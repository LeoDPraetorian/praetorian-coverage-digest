## 2026-01-22 - Initial Creation

**Phase:** RED (Proof of Gap)

**Gap Documented:** Graph Explorer requires table fallback when sub-clustering is exhausted (cluster still >1K nodes after max depth). No existing skill covers:
- Preserving selection when switching views
- Synchronizing filters between graph and table
- Smooth animations during transitions
- Drawer integration for side-by-side comparison

**Test Scenario:** User selects 5 nodes in graph view, switches to table view.

**Expected Failure:**
- Selection lost (table shows all rows, no highlighting)
- Applied filters reset (graph filtered by "active", table shows all)
- Jarring transition (instant swap, no animation)
- No way to return to graph (navigation broken)

**Category:** development/frontend/patterns

**Skill Type:** Process/Pattern

**Created By:** table-graph-hybrid-patterns specification from Graph Explorer 100K Scale feature research
