## 2026-01-02 - Initial Creation

**RED Phase Documentation:**

Gap: Currently, when developers want to create MCP wrappers (via `orchestrating-mcp-development`), there's no systematic way to:
1. Detect if an MCP server is already configured in `.claude/tools/config/lib/mcp-client.ts`
2. Guide users through installation from various sources (npm, PyPI, GitHub, local)
3. Automatically configure the MCP server with the correct command/args/envVars
4. Verify the MCP server is working before proceeding to schema discovery

Failure Scenario: The `orchestrating-mcp-development` skill would fail at Phase 1 (schema discovery) because the MCP isn't configured. The developer would need to manually search for the MCP package, determine if it's npm/PyPI/local, figure out the correct command syntax, edit `mcp-client.ts`, and test if it works.

**Category:** claude/mcp-tools (library skill)

**Skill Type:** Process/Pattern (MCP server setup workflow and configuration patterns)

**Content Source:** User-provided comprehensive workflow with 8 steps, 4 detailed examples, error handling patterns, and integration guidance. Research phase skipped per user request - content derived from original specification.

**Files Created:**
- SKILL.md (325 lines - within 500 line limit)
- references/command-configurations.md (patterns for npm, Python/uvx, Go, OAuth)
- references/example-configurations.md (6 complete examples with context)
- references/error-handling.md (recovery strategies, validation patterns)

**Integration Points:**
- Invoked at Phase 0.5 by `orchestrating-mcp-development`
- Modifies `.claude/tools/config/lib/mcp-client.ts`
- Optionally modifies `.claude/tools/config/credentials.json`

**Changes:**
- Initial skill structure created
- Progressive disclosure architecture with references/
- 8-step workflow for MCP server setup
- Support for npm (npx), Python (uvx), Go, and OAuth MCPs
- Comprehensive error handling patterns
- 6 real-world configuration examples
