# Q4FY25 Roadmap

[ Back to Overview](../OVERVIEW.md)

**Theme: Bring Threat Intelligence In-House**

This quarter, we pivot from foundational infrastructure to offensive scale, transforming Chariot into an end-to-end engine capable of competing on live bug bounty programs. We will equip Chariot to zero in on high-value targets, validate its findings to prove material risk, activate the learning loops for continuous improvement, and test its integrated capabilities in the real world.

## Major Milestone

**Bring Threat Intelligence In-House**: Deploy Chariot to compete on a live bug bounty program - the ultimate benchmark. Build our own internal exploit intelligence feed to replace third-party vendors (displacing VulnCheck, saving $225K). This is the first major step in the consolidation strategy, replacing a disparate point solution with integrated, proprietary intelligence that directly fuels agent decision-making.

## Learning Loops Not Started

Ensure Chariot grows smarter with every action by operationalizing the full performance feedback data pipeline.

**Implementation Status**: SageMaker ML pipeline is NOT implemented. This is a critical gap that blocks the "Proprietary Intelligence" tenet of the PRD. Data flows to S3 via Kinesis but uses GOB format, not Parquet.

| REQ ID        | Requirement                           | Rationale                                                                                      | Status               |

| REQ-PIPE-004  | Planner Model Feedback Pipeline       | Process traces to identify suboptimal plans; create dataset for prompt engineering/fine-tuning | Requires SageMaker   |
| REQ-WF-005    | Manual Finding Feedback Loop          | ManualFindingCreated event trigger; auto-create development backlog tickets                    |                      |

## Test AI Against Bug Bounty Programs Planned

The quarter culminates by deploying Chariot against a live public bug bounty program.

| REQ ID     | Requirement                                   | Rationale                                                                                | Status                   |
| ---------- | --------------------------------------------- | ---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- | ------------------------ |
| REQ-WF-006 | Bug Bounty Human Review & Submission Workflow | UI/CLI for sending Open Vulnerabilities to programs; human "thumbs up" before submission | Requires Workflow Engine |

## Critical Dependencies Not Met

1. **SageMaker ML Pipeline**: Required for Learning Loops, model fine-tuning, proprietary intelligence
2. **Workflow Engine**: Required for Bug Bounty workflows, automated validation cycles
3. **Parquet Data Format**: Currently uses GOB; reduces ML training data efficiency
