- Re-audit: Pending

## [2025-12-27] - Update Applied

### Changed
- Added `adhering-to-yagni` skill to frontmatter skills field (alphabetically)
- Added `adhering-to-yagni` to Tier 1 Read() calls
- Added "TanStack component integration" trigger in Tier 3 with path to integrating-tanstack-components skill
- Added "Context API patterns" trigger in Tier 3 with path to using-context-api skill

### Reason
- Agent needed scope discipline to prevent over-engineering in architectural decisions (adhering-to-yagni)
- Agent required TanStack integration patterns for coordinating Router, Query, Table, and Virtual (integrating-tanstack-components)
