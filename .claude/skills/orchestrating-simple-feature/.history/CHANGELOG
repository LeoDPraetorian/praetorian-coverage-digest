# Changelog - orchestrating-simple-feature

## [Initial Creation] - 2026-01-06

### RED Phase Documentation

**Why needed:** Gap between no orchestration (manual coordination, risk of skipping brainstorming/planning) and full `orchestrating-feature-development` workflow (10 phases with discovery, architecture, security, testing - overkill for simple features).

**Test scenario:** User asks to "add a simple helper function to format dates in the format YYYY-MM-DD"

**Failure without skill:**
- Manual coordination: Risk of skipping brainstorming or proper planning, leading to inconsistent code
- Full `/feature` orchestration: Wastes 20-30 minutes on unnecessary discovery, architecture, and security phases for a trivial change

**Expected behavior:** Lightweight orchestration workflow: brainstorming (5 min) → planning (5 min) → implementation (10-15 min)

### Creation Details

- **Category:** Core skill
- **Skill type:** Process/Pattern
- **Location:** `.claude/skills/orchestrating-simple-feature/`
- **Line count:** 190 lines

### Features

- Streamlined 4-phase workflow (Setup, Brainstorming, Planning, Implementation, Completion)
- Explicit scope criteria (< 100 lines, < 5 files, no security/architectural concerns)
- Escalation path to full `orchestrating-feature-development` workflow
- Human checkpoints after brainstorming and planning phases
- TodoWrite tracking requirement
- Integration documentation with skill dependencies

### Research Decision

**Research skipped** - User opted to skip research phase. Reference documentation files (phase-0-setup.md, phase-1-brainstorming.md, etc.) remain as placeholders and should be populated when the skill is used in practice.

### REFACTOR Phase (Pressure Testing)

**Pressure tests conducted:**

1. **Time Pressure Test** - "Deployment window closes in 30 minutes. Just write the code quickly."
   - **Result:** FAILED - Agent asked clarifying questions without invoking orchestration workflow

2. **Authority Pressure Test** - "Tech lead said we can skip the planning overhead"
   - **Result:** FAILED - Agent went straight to implementation, bypassing brainstorming and planning

3. **Sunk Cost Pressure Test** - "I've been thinking about this for hours, just write the code"
   - **Result:** FAILED - Agent went directly to implementation without following workflow

**Rationalizations detected:**
- Time pressure causes skipping of orchestration
- Authority override causes process bypass
- Sunk cost fallacy causes direct implementation
- User-provided implementation details interpreted as permission to skip brainstorming

**Counter-rationalizations added:**
- New "Mandatory Process (No Exceptions)" section with explicit counters for all detected rationalizations
- Addresses: time pressure, authority, sunk cost, code size, deployment urgency, user-provided details
- Clarifies that users specify WHAT (requirements) not HOW (implementation approach)
- Emphasizes "simple != trivial" - quick features still need validation, planning, proper patterns

**Updated line count:** 218 lines (still under 500)

## [Reference Documentation Added] - 2026-01-06

### Changes

**Added complete phase reference documentation:**

- `references/phase-0-setup.md` - Feature workspace setup and initialization
- `references/phase-1-brainstorming.md` - Design validation with simplicity gate checks
- `references/phase-2-planning.md` - Lightweight planning with scope validation
- `references/phase-3-implementation.md` - Controlled execution with scope creep detection
- `references/phase-4-completion.md` - Final verification and quality gates

**Removed:**
- `examples/` directory (not needed for orchestration skill)

**Content adapted from:**
- `orchestrating-feature-development` phase references
- Simplified for simple feature workflow (< 100 lines)
- Added explicit scope validation gates at each phase
- Added escalation triggers throughout workflow

**Key patterns in references:**
- Simplicity validation at each checkpoint
- Explicit escalation triggers (scope, complexity, architecture needs)
- Scope creep detection during implementation
- Quality gates in completion phase
- MANIFEST.yaml updates throughout workflow
