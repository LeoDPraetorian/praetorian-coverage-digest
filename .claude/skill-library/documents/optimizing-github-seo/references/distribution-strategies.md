# Distribution Strategies for GitHub Repositories

**External promotion and community engagement to maximize repository visibility.**

## Why Distribution Matters

**SEO gets people to find you. Distribution gets people to know you exist.**

**Reality**: Even with perfect SEO, your repository won't get discovered without active promotion.

**Benefits of distribution:**

- **Immediate traffic** (doesn't wait for SEO to work)
- **Social proof** (stars, forks, watchers)
- **Community building** (contributors, users, feedback)
- **Backlinks** (improves SEO over time)

## Platform-Specific Strategies

### 1. Dev.to

**Platform**: Developer blogging community with 1M+ developers

**Best for**: Tutorials, project launches, technical deep-dives

**Strategy:**

1. **Write launch post** (announcement + why you built it)
2. **Tutorial series** (how to use your project)
3. **Problem/solution posts** (the problem your project solves)
4. **Regular updates** (major features, milestones)

**Example post titles:**

```
✅ GOOD:
- "Building a Production-Ready FastAPI Authentication System"
- "How I Built a Type-Safe OAuth2 Client in TypeScript"
- "5 Lessons from Building an Open Source Authentication Library"

❌ BAD:
- "Check out my new project"
- "My GitHub repository"
- "FastAPI library"
```

**Optimization:**

- Add GitHub link in first paragraph
- Include code examples
- Use relevant tags (#fastapi #authentication #python)
- Engage with comments
- Cross-post to Medium, Hashnode

**Timing**: Publish during weekdays, 8-10am EST

### 2. Daily.dev

**Platform**: Personalized developer news aggregator

**Best for**: Technical articles, project launches, in-depth guides

**Strategy:**

1. Submit your blog posts (automatically if hosted on supported platforms)
2. Engage with relevant content
3. Build reputation with thoughtful comments

**Content that performs well:**

- Technical deep-dives
- Architecture explanations
- Performance optimizations
- Security best practices

### 3. Reddit

**Platform**: Discussion forum with developer communities

**Best for**: Authentic engagement, feedback, specific use cases

**Relevant subreddits:**

- r/programming (2.5M members)
- r/python (1.2M members)
- r/javascript (2.5M members)
- r/webdev (1.5M members)
- r/opensource (50k members)
- Language/framework-specific subs

**Strategy:**

1. **Participate first** (don't immediately self-promote)
2. **Share when relevant** (answering questions, not spamming)
3. **Saturday posts** work well (more relaxed about self-promotion)
4. **Provide value** (not just "I built a thing")

**Example posts:**

```
✅ GOOD:
"I spent 6 months building a type-safe OAuth2 library for FastAPI. Here's what I learned about token security [GitHub link]"

"I kept making the same authentication mistakes, so I built a library to prevent them. Would love feedback [GitHub link]"

❌ BAD:
"Check out my library"
"New authentication library on GitHub"
"I made a thing"
```

**Reddit rules:**

- Follow subreddit self-promotion rules (usually 10% of your posts max)
- Engage with comments authentically
- Don't delete and repost
- Be honest about it being your project

### 4. Hacker News

**Platform**: Tech news aggregator (Show HN section)

**Best for**: Innovative projects, interesting technical approaches

**Strategy:**

1. Post during optimal times (8-10am EST weekdays)
2. Write compelling title (mention what it does, not just what it is)
3. Engage with comments quickly

**Title format:**

```
Show HN: [Project Name] – [What it does in <10 words]

✅ GOOD:
"Show HN: FastAPI Auth – Production-ready OAuth2 and JWT for FastAPI"
"Show HN: TypeScript OAuth2 client with automatic token refresh"

❌ BAD:
"Show HN: My new authentication library"
"Show HN: FastAPI project I built"
```

**First comment**: Add context about why you built it, challenges, tech stack

### 5. Product Hunt

**Platform**: Product discovery for tech products

**Best for**: Developer tools, libraries with strong UX

**Strategy:**

1. **Prepare assets**:
   - Logo/icon
   - Screenshots/demo GIF
   - Tagline (60 chars max)
   - Description (260 chars max)
2. **Launch on Tuesday-Thursday** (best traffic days)
3. **Be available** for comments all day
4. **Ask community** to upvote (no direct asking in hunter rules)

**Example submission:**

```
Name: FastAPI Authentication
Tagline: Production-ready OAuth2 & JWT auth for FastAPI
Description: Add secure authentication to your FastAPI application in 5 minutes. Supports OAuth2, JWT, refresh tokens, and passwordless login.
```

### 6. Twitter/X

**Platform**: Real-time social network

**Best for**: Quick updates, threading explanations, community building

**Strategy:**

1. **Launch thread** (10-15 tweets explaining project)
2. **Regular updates** (features, milestones, usage tips)
3. **Engage** with relevant conversations
4. **Use hashtags** (#Python #FastAPI #WebDev)

**Launch thread structure:**

```
Tweet 1: Hook (problem statement)
"Authentication is hard. OAuth2 is complex. JWT has security gotchas.

I spent 6 months building a library to solve this for FastAPI 🧵"

Tweet 2-3: What it does
Tweet 4-5: Key features
Tweet 6-7: Code examples
Tweet 8-9: Why I built it
Tweet 10: Call to action (link to GitHub)
```

### 7. LinkedIn

**Platform**: Professional networking

**Best for**: Enterprise use cases, technical leadership content

**Strategy:**

1. **Detailed post** about the project (500-1000 words)
2. **Focus on business value** (not just technical features)
3. **Tag relevant companies/people**
4. **Use hashtags** for discoverability

## Blog Content Strategy

### Content Types

1. **Launch Post** - "Introducing [Project]"
2. **Tutorial Series** - "Getting Started with [Project]"
3. **Architecture Deep-Dive** - "How [Project] Works Under the Hood"
4. **Comparison Post** - "[Project] vs [Alternatives]"
5. **Use Case Studies** - "Using [Project] for [Specific Problem]"
6. **Update Posts** - "What's New in [Project] v2.0"

### SEO for Blog Posts

**Optimize for long-tail keywords:**

```
Target: "how to add oauth2 authentication to fastapi"
Title: "How to Add OAuth2 Authentication to FastAPI in 10 Minutes"
URL: /blog/fastapi-oauth2-authentication-guide
```

**Include:**

- Code examples

### Outreach Strategy

**Email template:**

```
Subject: [Your Project] - Would love your feedback

Hi [Name],

I'm a long-time follower of your [content/project] and recently
built [Your Project] which I think might interest you.

[One paragraph: what it does, why it's useful]

I'd love to hear your feedback if you have a moment to check it out:
[GitHub link]

No pressure at all - just wanted to share since it's related to
[what they work on].

Best,
[Your Name]
```

**Don't**:

- Ask for promotion directly
- Send generic mass emails
- Be pushy or follow up repeatedly

## Measuring Distribution Success

### Metrics to Track

1. **Referral traffic** (GitHub Insights → Traffic → Referrers)
2. **Stars/watchers growth** (before and after campaigns)
3. **Clone/fork rate**
4. **Issue/PR engagement**
5. **External links** (backlinks from blog posts, etc.)

### Tools

- **GitHub Insights**: Built-in traffic analytics
- **Google Analytics**: If you have project website
