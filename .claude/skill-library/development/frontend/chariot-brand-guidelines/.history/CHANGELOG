# Changelog - chariot-brand-guidelines

## [Date: 2025-12-23]

### Changed
- Added new "Styling Rules" section after "Usage Guidelines"
- Added "Theme Classes vs Hardcoded Colors" subsection with critical rule and examples
- Added "Common Theme Class Mappings" table with 10 common theme class patterns

### Reason
- Skill previously only documented WHAT colors exist (color values)
- Missing HOW to use them (theme classes vs hardcoded colors)
- Without explicit guidance, developers were hardcoding colors like `bg-gray-900` instead of using theme classes like `bg-layer0`
- Hardcoded colors break light/dark mode switching
- New section provides explicit rules with correct/wrong examples and a quick reference table

### Impact
- Developers now have clear guidance on theme class usage
- Prevents common anti-pattern of hardcoding Tailwind color utilities
- Maintains consistency with Chariot's design system
- File remains well within size limits (191 lines, under 350 threshold)

### REFACTOR Phase
- **Status**: Skipped (Not Required)
- **Reason**: This is additive documentation of existing design system patterns, not a workflow change with execution logic that agents could bypass
- **Change Type**: Content addition (guidance + examples), not rule changes or validation logic
