## 2026-01-22 - Initial Creation

**Phase:** RED

**Gap Documented:**
- Graph Explorer 100K Scale requires sub-clustering but no existing skill covers:
  - When to use Louvain vs Leiden vs attribute-based clustering
  - Server-side vs client-side computation trade-offs
  - Caching strategies for expensive computations
  - Handling cluster instability

**Test Scenario:** Developer needs to sub-divide a 50K node cluster by ASN attribute.

**Expected Failure:**
- Run clustering client-side → browser freezes
- Doesn't cache result → re-computes on every drill-down
- Uses Louvain → unstable results
- Doesn't validate quality → produces degenerate clusters

**Category:** development/frontend/graphing

**Skill Type:** Process/Pattern

**Location:** Library skill
