# TDD Validation: python-developer MANDATORY TDD

**Date**: 2025-11-19
**Pattern**: Same "Exception" loophole as go-developer
**Fix**: Exception → MANDATORY (same pattern, Python-specific example)

## RED: "Exception when explicitly requested" = opt-in TDD
## GREEN: "MANDATORY" closes loophole, Python retry example added
## REFACTOR: 3/3 pressure tests pass (same as go-developer)

Identical fix pattern to go-developer, validated.
