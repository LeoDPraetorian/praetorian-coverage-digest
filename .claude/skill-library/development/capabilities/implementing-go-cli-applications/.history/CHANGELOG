# Changelog - implementing-go-cli-applications

## [1.0.0] - 2026-01-05 - Initial Creation

### RED Phase Documentation
**Gap Identified**: No consolidated guidance for Go CLI development in Chariot platform
- Multiple CLI tools (nebula, praetorian-cli, trajan) lack consistency
- Framework selection criteria undocumented
- Configuration precedence patterns scattered
- UX best practices (error messages, progress, TTY detection) missing
- Binary size optimization for containers not addressed

**Test Scenario**: "Build a Go CLI for cloud infrastructure scanning with JSON/YAML output, error handling, and configuration management"

**Failure Without Skill**: Claude suggests frameworks without trade-offs, misses 12-Factor precedence, ignores POSIX conventions, provides generic errors, skips progress feedback, doesn't optimize for containers.

### Skill Details
- **Category**: development/backend
- **Type**: Process/Pattern
- **Location**: Library (reusable across all Go projects)
- **Line Count**: 471 lines (within 500 line limit)
- **Research**: Comprehensive 9-agent research completed (GitHub, Perplexity, Web × 3 interpretations)

### Content Structure
- Framework selection matrix (Cobra/Kong/urfave/stdlib)
- Configuration management (Koanf/Viper with 12-Factor precedence)
- UX best practices (POSIX, three-part errors, progress, TTY)
- Anti-patterns catalog
- Real-world references (kubectl, docker, gh, hugo, terraform)
- Chariot-specific recommendations

### Created By
- Skill management workflow v2.0
- TDD methodology enforced
- Progressive disclosure pattern applied
