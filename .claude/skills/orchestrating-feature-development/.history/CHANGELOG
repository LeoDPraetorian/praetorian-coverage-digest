# Changelog

All notable changes to the orchestrating-feature-development skill will be documented in this file.

## [Date: 2025-12-28]

### Changed (MAJOR WORKFLOW REDESIGN)
- **Workflow expanded from 5 phases to 8 phases** with parallel agent execution
- **Phase 3 (Architecture)**: Now uses domain leads (frontend-lead, backend-lead) + security-lead in PARALLEL instead of architect + reviewer pattern
- **Phase numbering shifted**: Testing moved from Phase 5 to Phase 6
- **Agent matrix updated**: Uses new agent names (frontend-lead, backend-lead, frontend-reviewer, frontend-security, etc.)

### Added
- **Phase 0: Setup** - Create feature directory with semantic naming (YYYY-MM-DD-{feature-name})
- **Phase 5: Code Review (NEW)** - Parallel code + security reviewers with explicit feedback loop (MAX 1 RETRY)
- **Phase 7: Test Assessment (NEW)** - Quality gate using test-lead with feedback loop (MAX 1 RETRY)
- **Feedback Loop Pattern**: MAX 1 RETRY then escalate to user (no infinite loops)
- **Parallel Execution Rules**: MANDATORY for independent agents in single Task message
- **Feature Directory Structure**: Centralized outputs to `.claude/features/YYYY-MM-DD-{name}/`

### New Reference Files
- `references/phase-5-code-review.md` - Parallel reviewers + feedback loop workflow
- `references/phase-7-test-assessment.md` - Test quality gate workflow

### Updated Reference Files
- `references/phase-3-architecture.md` - Rewritten for frontend-lead + security-lead pattern
- `references/phase-4-implementation.md` - Updated references to new Phase 5
- `references/phase-6-testing.md` - Renamed from phase-5, updated for parallel test modes

### Reason
- **RED Failure**: Architecture phase ran frontend-lead alone without security assessment. Security-lead only involved later (or never), missing early security review.
- **Additional Gap**: No code review phase existed - implementation went directly to testing without quality gate.
- **Additional Gap**: No test assessment phase - tests were written but quality not validated.
- **Solution**:
  1. Security-lead always included in architecture (Phase 3), spawned in parallel
  2. New Code Review phase (Phase 5) with parallel code + security reviewers
  3. New Test Assessment phase (Phase 7) with quality gate
  4. MAX 1 RETRY feedback loops prevent infinite loops

### Technical Details
- SKILL.md: 299 lines (compliant)
- phase-3-architecture.md: 328 lines (compliant)
- phase-5-code-review.md: 303 lines (compliant)
- phase-6-testing.md: 293 lines (compliant)
- phase-7-test-assessment.md: 285 lines (compliant)
- All files under 500-line limit ✅

### Agent Matrix
| Type | Leads (Phase 3) | Developers (Phase 4) | Reviewers (Phase 5) | Testers (Phase 6) |
|------|-----------------|----------------------|---------------------|-------------------|
| Frontend | frontend-lead + security-lead | frontend-developer | frontend-reviewer + frontend-security | frontend-tester ×3 |
| Backend | backend-lead + security-lead | backend-developer | backend-reviewer + backend-security | backend-tester ×3 |
| Full-stack | All 4 leads | Both developers | All 4 reviewers | All 6 testers |

## [Date: 2025-12-22]

### Changed
- **Phase 3 (phase-3-architecture.md)**: Added Step 8 for handling `needs_review` status from architecture agents
- **Exit Criteria**: Updated to explicitly require handling of `needs_review` status before proceeding to Phase 4
- **File Organization**: Extracted conflict resolution examples to `references/conflict-resolution-examples.md` for better organization (reduced main file from 439 to 496 lines after adding Step 8)

### Added
- **Step 8: Check Architecture Review Status and Revise Plan if Needed**
  - Handles `status='needs_review'` from architect/reviewer agents
  - Provides loop-back mechanism to Phase 2 (planning) when critical issues found
  - Offers user choice: revise plan, proceed with risks documented, or get more details
  - Documents plan revision workflow with progress file updates
  - Includes risk documentation template for "proceed with risks" path
- **New reference file**: `references/conflict-resolution-examples.md` with state management and component structure examples

### Reason
- **RED Failure**: Phase 3 workflow only handled `status='blocked'` but NOT `status='needs_review'`. When reviewer returned critical issues with `needs_review` status, the workflow incorrectly proceeded to Phase 4 without revising the plan, causing developers to implement flawed designs.
- **Impact**: This created a gap where architecture quality issues identified during review were ignored, leading to preventable implementation problems.
- **Solution**: New Step 8 checks agent status codes and provides structured decision flow for handling critical architecture feedback before implementation begins.

### Technical Details
- Steps renumbered: Old Step 8 → Step 9, Old Step 9 → Step 10
- New Step 8 inserted between Step 7 (validation) and Step 9 (progress update)
- Exit criteria now explicitly checks for `status="complete"` NOT `"needs_review"` or `"blocked"`
- Supports both plan revision (loop back to Phase 2) and risk acceptance (document in architecture.md)
- Final file size: 496 lines (under 500-line hard limit)

### REFACTOR
**Pressure Tests Run:**
- Test 1: Time pressure + Sunk cost - Agent must use AskUserQuestion, cannot auto-proceed
- Test 2: Authority pressure + Economic stakes - Agent must use AskUserQuestion despite CTO approval

**Test Results:**
- ✅ PASSED: Step 8 mandates AskUserQuestion, blocks automatic proceed to Phase 4
- ✅ PASSED: No exception for authority overrides or business pressure
- ⚠️ POTENTIAL LOOPHOLE IDENTIFIED: Agent might rationalize "stakeholders already said proceed" as implicit user input

**Recommendation for Future Iteration:**
Consider adding explicit counter in Step 8: "CRITICAL: This step is MANDATORY regardless of prior stakeholder approval, CTO endorsement, or business urgency. needs_review status means NEW information emerged that requires informed user choice."

**Current Status:**
- Skill successfully prevents auto-proceed to Phase 4 when needs_review status present
- Mandatory AskUserQuestion ensures user sees critical issues
- Authority/urgency pressures do not provide bypass mechanism in current implementation

## 2025-12-29 - Add Phase 6: Test Planning

**Change**: Inserted new Phase 6 (Test Planning), renumbered subsequent phases

**Phases Updated**:
- Phase 6: Test Planning (NEW) - test-lead creates test-plan.md
- Phase 7: Testing (was Phase 6) - testers follow test-plan.md
- Phase 8: Test Validation (was Phase 7) - test-lead validates against plan
- Phase 9: Completion (was Phase 8)

**Rationale**:
- Context propagation: All prior artifacts flow into test planning
- Goal-driven testing: Tests verify feature meets original goals
- Security integration: Security scenarios become explicit test cases
- Proactive quality: Define "what good looks like" BEFORE testing
- Symmetry: lead plans → implementer builds → lead validates (matches architecture pipeline)

**Files Modified**:
- SKILL.md: Added Phase 6, updated Quick Reference, workflow diagram, directory structure
- references/phase-6-test-planning.md: NEW - test planning workflow
- references/phase-7-testing.md: Renamed from phase-6, added test-plan.md input
- references/phase-8-test-validation.md: Renamed from phase-7, changed to validation mode
- references/phase-5-code-review.md: Updated next phase references

**Test Plan Inputs** (Phase 6):
- design.md (feature goals)
- plan.md (acceptance criteria)
- architecture.md (component structure, verification points)
- security-assessment.md (security test scenarios)
- implementation-log.md (actual implementation)

**Test Plan Output**:
- test-plan.md with coverage targets, required tests, security test cases, acceptance criteria tests, anti-patterns to avoid
