## 2026-01-06 - Initial Creation

**Category:** frameworks (library skill)
**Type:** Library/Framework

### RED Phase Documentation
- **Gap:** Developers can tag CWEs but don't know which are most critical for prioritization
- **Test Scenario:** "Should we prioritize CWE-352 or CWE-77?" → No data-driven answer without skill
- **Failure Without Skill:** Guess based on intuition, miss that 352 moved #9→#4 in 2024

### Initial Structure
- SKILL.md: 169 lines
- Top 25 list with 2024 rankings
- Trend data (rising/falling threats)
- KEV correlation section
- Prioritization guidance (High/Medium priority)
- Use case examples

### Pending
- Research phase to populate references/ with historical data
- Gateway update for routing
- GREEN/REFACTOR phases
