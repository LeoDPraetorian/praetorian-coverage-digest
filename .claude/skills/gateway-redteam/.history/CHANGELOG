# Changelog: gateway-redteam

## 2026-01-13 - Initial Creation

**Created by**: Claude Code (creating-skills workflow during customizing-nighthawk-profiles skill creation)

**Purpose**: Dedicated gateway for red team operational workflows, separating offensive security skills from defensive security (gateway-security).

**Type**: Gateway (routing index)
**Location**: Core skill - `.claude/skills/gateway-redteam/`

**Library Paths**: `redteam/*`

**Categories**:
1. C2 Frameworks - C2 framework customization and configuration
2. Payload Generation - Payload/implant generation workflows (planned)
3. OPSEC - Operational security validation for red team operations

**Initial Skills**:
1. `customizing-nighthawk-profiles` - Nighthawk C2 profile customization per-engagement

**Cross-Gateway Routing**:
- `gateway-security` - For security testing, threat modeling, defensive security
- `gateway-capabilities` - For security scanners, VQL, Nuclei
- `gateway-testing` - For testing workflows and validation

**Rationale**: Creating dedicated red team gateway provides:
- Clear organizational separation (offensive vs. defensive security)
- Dedicated namespace for red team service line workflows
- Room for expansion (Cobalt Strike, Sliver, Mythic, payload generation, OPSEC validation)
- Better discoverability for red team operators

**Future Expansion Planned**:
- Cobalt Strike malleable profile customization
- Sliver C2 configuration
- Payload generation and obfuscation workflows
- General red team OPSEC validation
- EDR evasion testing
