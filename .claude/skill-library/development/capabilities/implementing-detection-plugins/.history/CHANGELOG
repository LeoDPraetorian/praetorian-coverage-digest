## 2026-01-04 - Initial Creation

**RED Phase Documentation:**

Gap: No comprehensive guidance for implementing web vulnerability detection plugins in Go. Developers lack:
- Understanding of modular plugin architecture patterns (fingerprintx/go-cicd registry)
- Detection technique implementation (reflection, blind, time-based, OOB)
- Payload management strategies (WAF bypass, context-aware encoding)
- Chariot integration patterns (Tabularium Risk model, capability framework)

Failure Behavior (without skill):
- Generic plugin structure without following established registry patterns
- Single detection technique (reflection only), missing blind/OOB detection
- Hardcoded basic payloads without WAF evasion or encoding variants
- No guidance on Interactsh integration, confidence scoring, or false positive reduction
- Incomplete integration with Chariot's Tabularium and capability patterns

**Skill Details:**
- Category: development/capabilities
- Location: Skill Library
- Type: Process/Pattern
- Line Count: 333 lines

**Phase 6 Completion (No Research):**
User chose to skip research. Created 7 comprehensive reference files with practical patterns:
- plugin-architecture.md - Interface design and registry patterns
- detection-techniques.md - Reflection, blind, time-based, OOB detection
- vulnerability-patterns.md - OWASP Top 10 category-specific patterns
- payload-management.md - WAF bypass and encoding strategies
- oob-detection.md - Interactsh integration and callback handling
- chariot-integration.md - Tabularium Risk mapping and capability framework
- confidence-scoring.md - Multi-factor scoring algorithms

**Phase 7 Completion:**
Added skill to gateway-capabilities routing table:
- Intent Detection: "detection plugin" / "XSS" / "SQLi" → `implementing-detection-plugins`
- Skill Registry: Scanners & Chains section, triggers include detection plugin, XSS, SQLi, SSRF, OWASP
- Routing confirmed with capability-developer agent (primary consumer)

**Phase 8 GREEN Completion:**
✅ Skill successfully addresses the original gap:
- Plugin interface/registry patterns (fingerprintx/go-cicd style)
- Detection techniques (reflection, blind, time-based, OOB)
- OWASP Top 10 vulnerability patterns (XSS, SQLi, SSRF, XXE, etc.)
- Payload management with WAF bypass strategies
- Chariot integration (Tabularium Risk model, Interactsh OOB)
- Confidence scoring algorithms

✅ Quick compliance audit passed:
- Description format: valid
- Line count: 333/500 lines
- Progressive disclosure: 7 reference files with comprehensive patterns
- Gateway routing: added to gateway-capabilities
- Tool access: properly configured

**Phase 9 REFACTOR Completion:**
Pressure testing skipped per creating-skills guidance - this is a reference/pattern skill (like API documentation) without discipline rules to enforce or bypass. Agents have no incentive to rationalize away guidance when implementing detection plugins.

Skill type classification: Process/Pattern (reference guidance, not enforcement)
- Provides: Interface patterns, detection techniques, payload strategies
- Does NOT enforce: Mandatory steps, forbidden patterns, or compliance rules
- Similar to: API documentation, design pattern guides

**SKILL CREATION COMPLETE** ✅
