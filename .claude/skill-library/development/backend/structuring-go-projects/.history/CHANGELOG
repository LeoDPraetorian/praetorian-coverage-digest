# Changelog - structuring-go-projects

## 2026-01-06 - Initial Creation

**Phase**: RED-GREEN-REFACTOR (TDD)

**RED Phase Documentation:**
- **Gap identified**: Without this skill, Claude cannot systematically evaluate Go project structure compliance
- **Test scenario**: User asked "do modules nero, augustus, diocletian, and trajan follow golang standards?"
- **Failure observed**: Claude made ad-hoc observations without:
  - Systematic evaluation framework
  - Clear distinction between official vs community standards (golang-standards/project-layout)
  - Decision trees for when `/internal`, `/pkg`, `/cmd` are appropriate
  - Understanding of project complexity impact on structure decisions
  - Actionable recommendations for fixing non-compliance

**Skill Details:**
- **Location**: Skill Library
- **Category**: development/backend
- **Type**: Process/Pattern
- **Line count**: 270 (target <500)

**Content Sources:**
- Official Go documentation (go.dev/doc/modules/layout)
- golang-standards/project-layout (community pattern)
- 2025 best practices from web research
- Community debate on `/pkg` directory usage

**Phase 6 Completed**: Research incorporated from go.dev, golang-standards, and 2025 community best practices
- Created 5 reference files: official-guidance.md, community-patterns.md, decision-matrices.md, migration-examples.md, anti-patterns.md

**Phase 7 Completed**: Added to gateway-backend routing table with triggers: "Go structure", "project layout", "cmd pkg internal", "golang standards"

**Phase 8 GREEN Completed**: Verified skill closes the gap
- Re-tested original scenario (evaluate nero, augustus, diocletian, trajan)
- WITH skill: Provided systematic evaluation, identified specific issues, actionable fixes
- WITHOUT skill (Phase 1 RED): Made ad-hoc observations, no framework

**Phase 9 REFACTOR Completed**:
- Note: Pressure testing not applicable for reference/framework skills (per pressure-testing-skill-content methodology)
- Final audit PASSED:
  - Line count: 293 lines (well under 500 limit) ✅
  - Description format: Compliant with "Use when" pattern ✅
  - All reference files exist ✅
  - Gateway integration: Verified ✅

**Status**: PRODUCTION READY ✅
