## 2026-01-25 - Update for 1Password Migration

**RED Phase:**
- Gap: Skill documented sync credentials.json pattern, but codebase migrated to 1Password
- Test scenario: Developer follows skill to create REST API wrapper → uses deprecated sync createServiceClient() instead of async createServiceClientAsync()
- Failure: No documentation of async pattern, 1Password setup, or deprecation warnings

**Changes:**
1. HTTP Client Configuration section updated to show BOTH sync (deprecated) and async (recommended) patterns
2. Added "1Password Credential Setup" section with 3-step registration process
3. Updated Wrapper Structure template to show async client creation
4. Updated Phase 2 GREEN instructions to mention async pattern and 1Password registration
5. Marked sync pattern with deprecation warning and console.warn

**Verification:**
- Line count: 227 → 278 (well under 500-line limit)
- Only credentials.json mention is in deprecation comment (appropriate)
- Async pattern clearly marked as RECOMMENDED
- 1Password setup fully documented

## 2026-01-04 - Initial Creation

**RED Phase:**
- Gap: No orchestration skill for REST API wrapper development
- Test scenario: Ask Claude to "create a VirusTotal API wrapper" without skill → Claude wouldn't know to use http-client infrastructure, TDD workflow, or agent coordination
- Failure: Missing workflow documentation for REST API wrappers (MCP has orchestrating-mcp-development, REST APIs have none)

**Location:** .claude/skill-library/claude/mcp-management/orchestrating-api-tool-development/
**Category:** claude/mcp-management
**Type:** Process/Pattern (orchestration workflow)

**Context:**
- REST API wrapper infrastructure exists at .claude/tools/config/lib/http-client.ts
- Shodan reference implementation complete (.claude/tools/shodan/ with 51 passing tests)
- Architecture documented at .claude/.output/api-wrappers/http-client-architecture.md

**Rationale:**
Parallel to orchestrating-mcp-development but for REST APIs. Guides TDD workflow (RED-GREEN-REFACTOR), agent coordination (tool-tester → tool-developer → tool-reviewer), and token optimization patterns.
