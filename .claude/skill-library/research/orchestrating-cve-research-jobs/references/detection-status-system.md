# Detection Status System (Phase 3 Updates)

**How Phase 3 (CVE Research) refines detection status from Phase 2.**

## Status Updates When Jobs Created

| Phase 2 Status | Customer Exposure | Phase 3 Updated Status | Symbol | Meaning                                                           |
| -------------- | ----------------- | ---------------------- | ------ | ----------------------------------------------------------------- |
| GAP            | Assets affected   | **IN DEVELOPMENT**     | 🔶 🟠  | Gap identified, research active, customer exposed - HIGH priority |
| GAP            | No assets         | **IN DEV-NO EXPOSURE** | 🔶 🟢  | Gap identified, research active, customer safe - LOW priority     |

## Why This Matters

**Old approach (binary):**

```
GAP (🔴) = "You're blind and we're not fixing it"
```

**New approach (progressive):**

```
IN DEVELOPMENT (🟠) = "You're temporarily blind, but coverage is being built right now"
IN DEV-NO EXPOSURE (🟢) = "You're safe, and we're building coverage for the ecosystem"
```

**Customer perception:**

- ❌ **GAP alone:** Feels like abandonment, no action
- 🔶 **IN DEVELOPMENT:** Shows proactive response, builds trust
- Job tracking provides transparency (PR links, Linear tickets)

## Report Communication

**Phase 3 report should emphasize progress:**

## Detection Gap Remediation

The following detection gaps have been **addressed with active research**:

### CVE-2025-20393: Cisco AsyncOS Zero-Day

**Detection Status:** 🔶 **IN DEVELOPMENT** (🟠 Orange)
**Customer Impact:** 3 assets exposed
**Remediation Started:** 2026-01-12 23:30:00
**CVE Researcher Job:** RUNNING
**Expected Outputs:**

- Nuclei template PR (auto-generated)
- Linear tracking ticket (CHAR-567)
- Estimated completion: 10-30 minutes

**What this means:**

- ✅ Chariot is actively developing detection capability
- ✅ Template will be available for your next scan
- ✅ You'll be notified when coverage is live
- ⚠️ Manual mitigation still required until template deployed
```

## Integration with Threat Report Command

**Final status shown in consolidated report:**

```
Phase 1 (REPORT.md): GAP (tentative)
Phase 2 (IMPACT.md): GAP + 3 assets (refined)
Phase 3 (RESEARCH-JOBS.md): IN DEVELOPMENT (final)
```

**Customer sees evolution:**

1. "This CVE is a gap" (concerning)
2. "You have 3 exposed assets" (critical)
3. "We're building detection now - job running" (reassuring)

This progression transforms customer perception from "vulnerability" to "active protection development."
