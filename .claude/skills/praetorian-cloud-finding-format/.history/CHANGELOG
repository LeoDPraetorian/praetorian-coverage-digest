# Changelog

## [Conciseness Guidelines Added] - 2026-01-13

### Added

- **SKILL.md Critical Rules**: Three new rules about avoiding hyperbole, unnecessary bullet points, and repetition
- **writing-rules.md**: New "Conciseness and Clarity" section at top with four subsections:
  - Avoid Hyperbole (factual vs exaggerated language examples)
  - Avoid Unnecessary Bullet Points (when to use prose vs bullets)
  - Avoid Repetition Across Sections (progressive detail principle)
  - Be Succinct (remove filler phrases, direct statements)

### Changed

- **SKILL.md**: Added 4 lines to Critical Rules (hyperbole, bullets, repetition, succinctness)
- **writing-rules.md**: Added 104 lines of detailed guidance with examples

### Metadata

- **Source**: User clarification "do not add hyperbole and unnecessary bullet points. do not consistently repeat across multiple sections and bullet points when a succinct point conveying the idea can be made instead"
- **Line Count**: 301 lines (was 297) - still under 500 limit
- **Backup**: 2026-01-13-09-50-02-pre-hyperbole-update.bak

### RED Phase Documentation

**Gap**: Skill didn't explicitly warn against hyperbole, unnecessary bullet points, or repetitive content across sections.

**Failure without fix**:
1. Claude might write findings with exaggerated language ("catastrophic", "devastating", "massive breach")
2. Create bullet points where prose would be more concise
3. Repeat same information in multiple sections instead of progressive detail
4. Use verbose phrasing with filler words

**Evidence**: User requested explicit guidance to avoid hyperbole and repetition, ensure succinct communication.

## [Initial Creation] - 2026-01-13

### Added

- Core skill for Praetorian cloud security finding format
- Six-section structure: Vulnerability Description, Impact, Resources Impacted, Verification and Attack Information, Recommendations, References
- CVSS 4.0 base metrics calculation guidance
- Comprehensive writing rules (voice, tone, formatting, client references)
- Progressive disclosure with three reference files
- Example S3 bucket finding demonstrating complete format

### Skill Details

- **Category**: Core skill
- **Type**: Process/Pattern (writing methodology)
- **Line Count**: 297 lines (SKILL.md) - under 500 limit
- **References Created**: writing-rules.md, finding-structure.md, cvss-calculation.md

### RED Phase Documentation

**Gap**: Claude doesn't know Praetorian's cloud security finding writing format and standards.

**Failure without skill:**

1. Claude uses generic security writing style instead of Praetorian-specific voice
2. Doesn't follow 6-section H4 structure (Vulnerability Description, Impact, Resources Impacted, Verification and Attack Information, Recommendations, References)
3. Doesn't apply writing rules (avoid "Praetorian" repetition, use `%%CLIENT_SHORT%%`, backticks for resources, past tense, active voice)
4. Doesn't generate CVSS 4.0 base metrics correctly
5. Doesn't follow structured Verification format (Part 1: discovery, Part 2: demonstration steps, Part 3: quantifiable results)
6. Recommendations too prescriptive with implementation details instead of strategic guidance

**Test Scenario**: Ask Claude to "Write a cloud security finding about an S3 bucket with overly permissive policies" without this skill.

**Expected Failure**: Generic format, missing sections, wrong heading levels, improper voice, no CVSS rating or incorrect format, missing image caption format, resource inline code formatting not applied.

**Evidence**: User provided complete Praetorian finding format specifications including writing rules, section structure, section intentions, target audiences, and detailed example. Without this skill, Claude would not apply these Praetorian-specific standards.
