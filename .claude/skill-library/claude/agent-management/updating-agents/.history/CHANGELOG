- **2025-12-13 (15:45)**: Enhance EXTREMELY_IMPORTANT block verification requirements with obra/superpowers patterns.

Key changes:
1. Added "Critical Understanding" section explaining skills: frontmatter does NOT auto-invoke (discovery vs execution cost)
2. Updated template with obra/superpowers absolute language ("MUST", "not optional", "cannot rationalize")
3. Added all 5 anti-rationalization patterns with explicit counters
4. Enhanced verification section (3.3.4) to check BOTH process + behavioral compliance
5. Added evaluation matrix: PASS, FAIL (silent), FAIL (lip service), FAIL (ignored)
6. Expanded manual checklist (5.3) with 7 specific checks for Mandatory Skills updates
7. Added "Why fresh session?" explanation (agent metadata caching)
8. Added "Common failure" note about behavioral vs process compliance gap

Reason: User feedback revealed agents with updated Mandatory Skills sections weren't consistently showing explicit skill invocation, making verification impossible.
