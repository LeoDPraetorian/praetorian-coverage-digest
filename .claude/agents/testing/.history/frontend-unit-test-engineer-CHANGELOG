# frontend-unit-test-engineer Changelog

## 2025-12-27 (Update 2)

### Changed
- **Tier 3 Skills Expansion** - Added 7 library skills to Tier 3 trigger table based on find-skills semantic analysis:
  - `condition-based-waiting` (80% relevance) - Async timing, race conditions, flaky test elimination
  - `using-context-api` (75% relevance) - Testing Context-dependent components
  - `using-eslint` (60% relevance) - Code quality verification for test files
  - `implementing-react-hook-form-zod` (85% relevance) - Form lifecycle and validation testing
  - `vitest-prepush-testing` (70% relevance) - Pre-push hook test infrastructure
  - `using-shadcn-ui` (65% relevance) - Testing shadcn/ui component primitives
  - `using-tanstack-query` (90% relevance) - Testing useQuery/useMutation hooks
- **Alphabetical Sorting** - Re-sorted Tier 3 table by trigger description for easier navigation
- **Rationale** - Addresses skill gaps for testing modern React patterns heavily used in Chariot platform (TanStack Query, React Hook Form, Context API, shadcn/ui)

### Fixed
- **Phase 9: Tier 2 TodoWrite Threshold** - Changed "≥3 steps" to "≥2 steps" (line 33) to comply with MANDATORY requirement for all agents
- **Phase 14: Duplicate Skill Trigger Mappings** - Removed duplicate "Skill References" section (lines 141-149) to eliminate content duplication with Tier 3
- **Phase 16: Verbose Triggers** - Shortened 3 triggers in Tier 3 table for readability:
  - "Test completion reporting, coverage validation" → "Coverage validation" (19 chars)
  - "Reviewing test files, test quality checks" → "Test quality" (12 chars)
  - "Multi-component features, test planning" → "Integration tests" (17 chars)
- **Verification** - Re-audit passed (Phase 0 + all manual phases)
