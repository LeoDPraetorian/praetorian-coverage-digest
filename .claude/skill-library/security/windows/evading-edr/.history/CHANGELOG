# Changelog - evading-edr

## 2026-01-09 - Initial Creation

**Type**: Library/Framework skill
**Category**: security/windows
**Location**: `.claude/skill-library/security/windows/evading-edr/`

**RED Phase Documentation**:

**Gap**: When users ask questions about EDR architecture, detection mechanisms, evasion techniques, function hooking, kernel callbacks, ETW internals, or offensive security tradecraft, Claude:
- Relies on training data that may not cover latest EDR implementations
- Cannot reference specific evasion techniques, sensor components, or detection logic from authoritative offensive security sources
- Misses technical details about EDR internals crucial for red team operations and security tool development
- Cannot provide citations from Matt Hand's comprehensive EDR evasion guide

**Test Scenario**: User asks "How do EDRs use ETW for telemetry collection? What are the bypass techniques?"

**Expected Behavior**: Claude reads `EvadingEDR/chapters/chapter-08.md`, explains ETW provider architecture, trace sessions, consumer mechanisms, discusses ETW patching and tampering techniques, and cites Evading EDR by Matt Hand.

**GREEN Phase**: TBD - Will verify skill provides access to EDR architecture and evasion techniques.

**Book Details**:
- Author: Matt Hand
- Publisher: No Starch Press (2024)
- Focus: EDR architecture from offensive security perspective, evasion techniques

**Chapters Available**: 0-2, 4-5, 7-8, 11-13 (EDR architecture, Function hooks, Object notifications, Image-load/registry notifications, Network filters, ETW, ELAM, Threat-Intelligence provider, Detection-aware attack case study)

**Content Source**: OCR-transcribed markdown chapters in `EvadingEDR/chapters/` with automated error corrections applied (9 lines fixed including EDR Architecture capitalization, Mimikatz corrections).

**Security Context**: This book describes offensive security techniques. Use ONLY in authorized contexts: pentesting engagements, red team exercises, security research on owned systems, CTF competitions, defensive analysis.

**Related Skills**:
- `windows-internals` - **FREQUENTLY PAIRED** - Provides OS foundation (processes, drivers, kernel) for EDR concepts
- `windows-security-internals` - Authentication and token manipulation in evasion context

## 2026-01-09 - GREEN Phase Verified

**Test Scenario**: Verified access to Chapter 8 "Event Tracing for Windows" with ETW architecture, provider/consumer model, and telemetry collection details.

**Result**: SUCCESS ✅
- Skill successfully routes to `EvadingEDR/chapters/chapter-08.md`
- Chapter contains complete ETW architecture, logging facility usage, EDR telemetry collection mechanisms, and evasion techniques
- Offensive security perspective documented with authorization requirements

**Gateway Integration**: Added to `gateway-security` with triggers "EDR", "EDR evasion", "function hooking", "ETW"

## 2026-01-09 - REFACTOR Phase Complete

**Pressure Test Approach**: Library/Framework reference skills (passive documentation) - sanity checks performed.

**Result**: Skills provide reliable access to Matt Hand's authoritative EDR evasion techniques. Security context warnings included (authorized use only).

## 2026-01-09 - Chapter Files Relocated

**Change**: Copied all chapter files from repository root to `references/chapters/` within skill directory.

**After**: Chapters included in `references/chapters/` (10 files: chapter-00.md, 01-02, 04-05, 07-08, 11-13)

**Updated Paths**: `.claude/skill-library/security/windows/evading-edr/references/chapters/chapter-0N.md`

**Rationale**: Self-contained for version control.
