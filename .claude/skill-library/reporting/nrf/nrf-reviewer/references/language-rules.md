# Language Transformation Rules

This file summarizes language transformation rules from the SKILL.md Phase 1 section. Key rules:

## Critical Substitutions
- "recommend" → "suggest {{client_short}} consider"
- "Recommendations" → "Areas for Improvement"
- "should" → "may wish to consider"
- "ensure" → "may reduce the likelihood"

## Impact Enhancers to Remove
- critical, extensive, substantial, significant, systemic, systematic, fundamental, devastating, severe, widespread

## Hedging Patterns
- Add "may", "could potentially", "appears to" for potential impacts
- Do NOT hedge verified findings and factual test results

## Attack Terminology (Context-Dependent)

**Attack terminology is generally acceptable, but NRF reviews may vary:**

- ✅ Often accepted: "malicious actor", "attacker", "adversary", "exploit"
- ⚠️ Sometimes changed: "attackers" → "users" (depending on context/reviewer)

**Why this varies:** NRF reviews are conducted by different reviewers with different preferences. Some contexts (e.g., describing specific attack scenarios) warrant attack terminology, while others (e.g., describing user actions) may prefer neutral terms.

**Guidance:**
- Preserve attack terminology when describing threat scenarios and attack chains
- Be prepared for reviewer feedback requesting changes in either direction
- When in doubt, keep the original technical terminology and let NRF request changes

**Do NOT over-neutralize:** Changing "malicious actor" → "actor" or removing "attacker" entirely loses important threat context. It's better to keep attack terms and have NRF request specific changes than to pre-emptively sanitize.
