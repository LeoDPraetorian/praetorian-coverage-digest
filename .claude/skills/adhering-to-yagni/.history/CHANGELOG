## 2026-01-18 - Compliance Fix (Phase 28)

**Method:** Claude-Automated

**Changes:**
- Added Integration section with all required subsections:
  - Called By: Documents when skill is invoked (any development work)
  - Requires: None (standalone skill)
  - Calls: AskUserQuestion tool for scope validation
  - Pairs With: developing-with-tdd, debugging-systematically, verifying-before-completion

**Result:** Phase 28 now passes. Skill dependencies are now explicit and traceable.

**Remaining Issues:**
- Phase 4 & 26: 7 broken links to missing reference/example files (CRITICAL)
  - references/bug-fix-scenarios.md
  - references/feature-implementation.md
  - references/code-review.md
  - references/while-im-here.md
  - references/workflow.md
  - examples/feature-implied-requirements.md
  - examples/refactoring-boundaries.md
- Phase 1: Description at length limit (119/120 chars) (WARNING)

**Next Steps:** Create missing reference/example files or remove broken links from SKILL.md

## 2026-01-13 - Add Go-Specific Anti-Patterns

**Changes:**
1. Created new reference file `references/go-anti-patterns.md` with 7 Go-specific YAGNI violations
2. Added Go-Specific Violations table to main SKILL.md for visibility
3. Added reference link in Anti-Patterns section

**New anti-patterns documented:**
- Compile-time interface compliance checks (`var _ Interface = (*Type)(nil)`)
- Version package scaffolding for simple CLIs
- Useless comments that repeat function names
- Empty placeholder types
- Overly generic error types
- Premature interface extraction
- Giant config structs before knowing needs

**Why:**
Julius code review showed these patterns being added without being requested:
- `var _ types.OutputWriter = (*TableWriter)(nil)` - unnecessary
- `version/version.go` package - unnecessary for simple CLI
- Comments on every function - unnecessary

**Test scenario:**
- User asks to create CLI tool
- backend-developer creates code with interface compliance vars, version package, useless comments
- Expected: None of these unless explicitly requested
- After fix: Go-Specific Violations table makes these explicit YAGNI violations
