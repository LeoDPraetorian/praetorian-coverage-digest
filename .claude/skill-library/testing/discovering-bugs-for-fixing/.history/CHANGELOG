# Changelog

## 2026-01-15 - Initial Creation

**RED Phase Documentation:**
- Gap: orchestrating-bugfix workflow needs Phase 1-2 capability for bug scoping and discovery
- Without skill: Orchestrations must manually implement bug location discovery each time
- Failure: No standardized process for determining agent count or spawning Explore agents for bug investigation
- Need: Reusable two-stage workflow (scoping → discovery) for unknown bug locations

**Skill Details:**
- Category: development/
- Type: Process/Pattern
- Location: Skill Library

**GREEN Phase:**
- Skill structure validated: 226 lines (under 500 limit)
- Frontmatter compliance verified
- 5 reference files created with substantive content (50+ lines each)
- Integration section present with Called By, Requires, Spawns, Hands Off To
- Gateway routing added to gateway-testing
- Ready for orchestrating-bugfix integration testing

**Implementation:**
- Two-stage process: Bug Scoping (Stage 1) and Discovery (Stage 2)
- Agent count logic: 0 (known location), 1 (single candidate), 2-5 (parallel), 0 (>5 or ask user)
- Outputs: bug-scoping-report.json, discovery-{component}.md, candidate-locations.md
- Integration with persisting-agent-outputs for OUTPUT_DIR
- Handoff to debugger agent after discovery

**REFACTOR Phase:**
- Added Anti-Rationalization Guards section with common bypass attempts
- Counters for: "obvious location", "skip Stage 1", "spawn all candidates", "skip OUTPUT_DIR", "grep is enough", "no time"
- "Not even when" guards for urgency, simplicity, grep findings, user-provided paths
- Final line count: 245 (under 500 limit)
