### Fixed
- **Phase 5/10 CRITICAL**: Removed `analyzing-cyclomatic-complexity` from frontmatter skills (library skill incorrectly in frontmatter)
  - Also removed from Tier 1 in Skill Loading Protocol
  - Skill accessible via `gateway-backend` (already in frontmatter)

- **Phase 14 WARNING**: Removed duplicate "Skill References (Load On-Demand via Gateway)" section (lines 24-46)
  - Content duplicated Tier 3 trigger table
  - Consolidated into Tier 3 only per Tiered Skill Loading Protocol pattern
  - Eliminated ~23 lines of duplication

- **Phase 15 CRITICAL**: Fixed invalid library skill paths in Tier 3
  - Removed 6 non-existent skill paths:
    - `backend-dynamodb-patterns` (does not exist)
    - `backend-go-concurrency` (does not exist)
    - `backend-api-design` (does not exist)
    - `backend-microservices-design` (does not exist)
    - `backend-repository-pattern` (does not exist)
    - `ops-aws-lambda` (does not exist)
  - Replaced with gateway delegation pattern

### Result
- **Before**: 257 lines with 3 critical issues, 1 warning
