## 2026-01-01 - Cross-Reference to Generic GraphQL Patterns

**What changed:**
- Added cross-reference to `building-graphql-batch-clients` skill in Related Skills section
- Added note to GraphQL Query Structure (Critical Rule #3) pointing to generic patterns
- Created `references/generic-graphql-extraction.md` documenting Burp-specific vs reusable patterns
- Organized Related Skills into "GraphQL Patterns" and "Concurrency & Testing" subsections

**Line count:** 340 → 351 (11 lines added, all cross-references)

**Why:** Developers implementing GraphQL clients for GitHub/GitLab/Azure APIs can now discover generic patterns (variable binding, rate limiting, error handling, pagination, batch queries, testing) that were originally demonstrated in burp-integration but are now extracted to a dedicated skill.

**Burp-specific patterns remain unchanged:**
- Site provisioning workflow
- Scan lifecycle management
- Chariot header injection
- Result processing and conversion

**Generic patterns now in building-graphql-batch-clients:**
- Variable binding (security)
- Rate limiting approaches
- Error response structure
- Testing with httptest.NewServer
- Batch query construction
- Cursor-based pagination

**Verification:**
- All existing Burp-specific content unchanged
- Changes are additive (cross-references only)
- Skill remains focused on Burp integration
