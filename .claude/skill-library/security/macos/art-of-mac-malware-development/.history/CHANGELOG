## 2026-01-12 - Initial Creation

**RED Phase Documentation:**
- **Gap identified**: When analyzing macOS malware, investigating Mac-specific infection vectors, persistence mechanisms, or developing Mac security tools, Claude needs authoritative reference material covering Mac malware analysis techniques and methodologies
- **Test scenario**: "Walk me through analyzing a suspicious macOS application: how do I identify persistence mechanisms, extract capabilities, and perform dynamic analysis?"
- **Without skill**: Claude would provide general malware analysis principles that may not apply to macOS-specific mechanisms (launch agents, dylib hijacking, code signing, etc.) or miss critical Mac-specific tools and techniques
- **With skill**: Claude can reference Patrick Wardle's authoritative guide, providing Mac-specific analysis workflows, tool recommendations (Objective-See tools, Hopper, LLDB), and understanding of macOS-specific mechanisms

Part II: Mac Malware Analysis
- Chapter 4: Nonbinary analysis (scripts, packages, disk images, Office docs)
- Chapter 5: Binary triage (Mach-O, code signing, dependencies, symbols)
- Chapter 6: Disassembly and decompilation (Objective-C, Hopper, IDA, Ghidra)
- Chapter 7: Dynamic analysis tools (ProcessMonitor, FileMonitor, network monitors)
- Chapter 8: Debugging (LLDB, breakpoints, memory inspection)
- Chapter 9: Anti-analysis techniques (VM detection, anti-debugging, obfuscation)

Part III: Analyzing EvilQuest
