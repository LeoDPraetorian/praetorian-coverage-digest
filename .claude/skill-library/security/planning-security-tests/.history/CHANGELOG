**RED Phase Documentation:**

**Gap**: The security-test-planner agent (243 lines) exceeds the 200-line agent best practice. Lines 122-213 contain an 84-line embedded Phase 6 test planning workflow with:
- 5-step methodology (load phases, prioritization formula, 4 test categories, priority matrix, summary)
- Detailed artifact schemas and field requirements
- Prioritization formula with crown jewel and compliance bonuses
- Critical rules about evidence-based planning

**Problem**: This embedded workflow makes the agent too long and violates the principle of extracting reusable methodology into library skills for reference.

**Test Scenario**: Without this skill, the security-test-planner agent must embed all workflow details inline, causing:
- Agent line count to exceed recommended limits
- Workflow knowledge duplicated if multiple agents need test planning
- Harder to maintain and update test planning methodology
- Reduced agent clarity (methodology embedded vs referenced)

**Solution**: Extract the Phase 6 test planning methodology into this library skill, allowing security-test-planner to reference it via gateway-security routing.

- Step 1: Load Phase Outputs (Phase 1/3/5 artifacts)
- Step 2: Apply Prioritization Formula (Risk + Crown Jewel + Compliance)
- Step 3: Generate Test Recommendations (4 categories with schemas)
- Step 4: Generate Prioritization Matrix (ranked by formula)
- Step 5: Generate Summary (<2000 tokens)
