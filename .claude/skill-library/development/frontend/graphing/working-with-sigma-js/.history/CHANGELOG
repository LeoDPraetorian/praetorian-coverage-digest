All notable changes to this skill will be documented in this file.

## [Initial Creation] - 2026-01-14

### Added

- Initial skill creation via creating-skills workflow
- Core concepts: graphology data structure, camera events, node programs, settings, visibility, event handlers
- Three common patterns: debounced camera handler, zoom-based LOD, layout integration
- Performance guidelines table with node/edge/icon thresholds
- Integration section documenting skill dependencies

### RED Phase Documentation

**Gap:** Developers working with Sigma.js in React need specific guidance on:

- Camera event handling (60+ events/second requiring debouncing)
- Node program performance (icon rendering cliff at 5,000 nodes)
- Settings management and runtime appearance changes
- Graphology integration patterns

**Failure without skill:** Claude provides generic React optimization advice instead of Sigma.js-specific patterns, misses critical performance thresholds, doesn't reference existing research synthesis.

**Test scenario:** Developer building graph explorer with 5,000+ nodes encounters performance issues and infinite re-renders from camera handlers.
