# Retroactive Validation: react-architect Brainstorming Section

**Date**: 2025-11-19
**Status**: Existing section validated as EXCELLENT (no changes needed)

## GREEN Phase Validation (Retroactive)

**Current brainstorming section (lines 45-84):**

### Strengths vs Our New Additions

| Aspect | react-architect (existing) | Others (just added) |
|--------|---------------------------|---------------------|
| Requirement | "REQUIRED for all architecture work" | "REQUIRED" |
| Process steps | 3 detailed steps | 3 basic steps |
| Clarifying questions | 5 specific questions listed | Generic "ask questions" |
| No exceptions | 5 exceptions listed | 3 exceptions listed |
| Why explanation | ✅ Present (line 78) | ❌ Missing |
| Evidence | ✅ From RED phase (WebSocket example) | ❌ Missing |
| Tagline | "Architects explore, technicians jump" | Same pattern |

**Result**: ✅ PASS - react-architect section is MORE thorough than what we added to others

## Comparison to Our Pattern

**We added to general-system/go-backend/security:**
```markdown
**MANDATORY: Use brainstorming skill before recommending...**

**The Process (REQUIRED):**
1. Understand requirements FIRST
2. Explore 2-3 alternative approaches
3. Validate approach BEFORE detailed design

**No exceptions:**
- Not when "solution is obvious"
- Not when "best practice is clear"
- Not when "time pressure"
```

**react-architect has (better):**
```markdown
**Before recommending ANY specific architectural solution:**

🚨 **Use brainstorming skill for design exploration...**

**The Process (REQUIRED for all architecture work)**:
1. **Understand the idea FIRST** (5 specific clarifying questions listed)
2. **Explore 2-3 alternative approaches** (with pros/cons template)
3. **Validate approach BEFORE detailed design** (get feedback, ensure constraints understood)

**No exceptions:**
- Not when "solution is obvious"
- Not when "user wants answer now"
- Not when "standard pattern"
- Not when "expert knowledge"
- Not when "simple feature"

**Why:** 30 min brainstorming prevents weeks of rework

**Evidence from RED phase:** WebSocket prescription without exploration
```

## Recommendation

**NO changes needed to react-architect** - it's the gold standard

**Optional**: Could strengthen other 3 architects to match react-architect thoroughness, but current additions are sufficient (MANDATORY + basic process + pressure resistance)

**Validation complete**: react-architect brainstorming section is bulletproof
