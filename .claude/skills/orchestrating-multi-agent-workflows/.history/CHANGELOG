### Changed
- **References** section - Added 3 new reference links (gated-verification, quality-scoring, clarification-protocol)
- **Progress file format** - Updated minimal format to include quality metrics and checkpoint tracking
- **Progress file completed phases** - Added checkpoint and quality_score metadata fields

### Context
Backported battle-tested patterns from orchestrating-feature-development into this foundational protocol skill. Over time, the specific implementation (orchestrating-feature-development) developed advanced patterns that should be generalized into the foundational multi-agent coordination skill.

Problems addressed:
1. **No gated verification** - Reviews happened in single pass, wasting effort when spec compliance failed
2. **Limited status values** - Couldn't distinguish "stuck" (blocked) from "need input" (needs_clarification)
3. **No retry limits** - Feedback loops could run indefinitely without escalation
4. **Unstructured checkpoints** - Escalation mentioned but not with clear protocol
5. **Subjective quality** - "Good enough" judgments instead of quantitative scoring
6. **No rationalization prevention** - No detection or override protocol for workflow deviations
7. **No complexity triggers** - Related skills mentioned but no threshold rules for invocation

Solutions:
- Two-stage gated verification separates compliance (did they do what was asked?) from quality (did they do it well?)
- Extended status values with structured clarification format (category, question, options, impact)
- Default retry limits (Stage 1: 2, Stage 2: 1) with AskUserQuestion escalation templates
- Human checkpoint framework with when/how guidance and metadata tracking
- Quality scoring with weighted factors (completeness 40%, correctness 30%, quality 20%, edge_cases 10%)
- Rationalization prevention table with detection phrases and override protocol
- Conditional triggers with measurable conditions (task counts, independence, duration estimates)

Impact:
- Orchestrators now have quantitative thresholds instead of subjective judgments
- Clear retry limits prevent infinite loops
- Gated verification saves effort by checking spec before quality
- Structured clarification format enables better agent communication
- Rationalization detection prevents workflow shortcuts
- Complexity triggers automate supporting skill invocation

### Line Count
- Before: 415 lines
- After: ~750 lines (SKILL.md)
- New reference files: 3 (gated-verification.md: 289 lines, quality-scoring.md: 280 lines, clarification-protocol.md: 386 lines)
- Total addition: ~1200 lines across 4 files

Note: Main SKILL.md is now ~750 lines. While above 500-line soft limit, this is justified as foundational protocol that other orchestration skills build upon. Consider future extraction of some sections to references if grows beyond 800 lines.

## [2026-01-10] - Post-Completion Verification Protocol

### Added
- **Post-Completion Verification Protocol (MANDATORY)** section after "Conflict Detection" (lines 245-310)
- **5-step verification process** orchestrators MUST follow when ANY agent returns:
  1. Read the Output File (not just response summary)
  2. Verify Metadata Block Exists (JSON with agent, skills_invoked, source_files_verified, status)
  3. Compare skills_invoked Against Mandatory List (catch missing skill invocations)
  4. Verify Exit Criteria (quote criteria, check COUNT and UNIT)
  5. Only Then Mark Complete (5-point checklist with evidence)
- **Real failure documentation**: "118 calls updated" vs 47 files touched incident
- **Why This Protocol Exists** explanation linking to orchestrator-enforcement hook

### Context
Real failure: Orchestrator trusted agent's response summary ("118 calls updated") without reading output file. Output file showed only 47 files touched. The agent counted function calls, not files. Verification would have caught this after first batch, not fourth batch.

Problem: Orchestrators were marking phases complete based on response summaries without verifying:
- Output file contents
- Metadata block presence (per persisting-agent-outputs)
- skills_invoked array against mandatory list
- Exit criteria with COUNT/UNIT verification

Solution: Added mandatory 5-step verification protocol that orchestrators MUST follow before marking any agent complete. Protocol enforces:
- Reading actual output files (not trusting summaries)
- Metadata compliance checking
- Skills invocation verification
- Exit criteria validation with evidence

Impact:
- Prevents orchestrators from trusting misleading response summaries
- Catches missing skill invocations (agents that skip verifying-before-completion)
- Enforces COUNT and UNIT verification (prevents function calls vs files confusion)
- Creates checkpoint after EVERY agent return (not just at workflow end)
- Links to orchestrator-enforcement hook for reminder mechanism

Line count impact: +67 lines (348 → 415 lines)

## [2026-01-04] - Effort Scaling Guidance

### Added
- **Effort Scaling** section with 4-tier complexity table (Simple/Moderate/Complex/Major) mapping agent counts to tool call estimates
- **Scaling Tiers table** with concrete examples: 1 agent (3-10 calls) for bug fixes, up to 10+ agents for major refactors
- **Decision Checklist** with 4 questions to assess if multi-agent is justified (15x token cost consideration)
- **Interdependent Task Warning** with signs to watch for (serial dependencies, shared state, tight coupling, iterative cycles)
- **Alternatives for interdependent work** (single agent with TodoWrite, sequential spawning, manual orchestration)

### Changed
- **"When to Orchestrate vs Delegate Directly"** section now references Effort Scaling tiers and adds "Task complexity is 'Simple' tier (3-10 tool calls expected)" criterion
- **Anti-Patterns** section expanded with two new items:
  - Item 7: "Ignoring token cost: Multi-agent uses 15x more tokens—don't orchestrate simple tasks"
  - Item 8: "Parallelizing interdependent work: Serial tasks should stay serial, don't force parallel"

### Context
Research from Anthropic's multi-agent systems documentation specifies clear effort scaling rules. Without this guidance, orchestrators either:
1. Over-orchestrate simple tasks (wasteful - multi-agent uses 15x more tokens)
2. Under-orchestrate complex tasks (miss parallel execution benefits)
3. Make inconsistent decisions about agent counts

This update provides objective criteria for matching agent count to task complexity and recognizing when NOT to use multi-agent orchestration.

## [2026-01-04] - Centralized Agent Routing

### Added
- **Agent Routing Table** in "Handling Agent Results" section - provides decision matrix for spawning next agent based on blocked reason
- **Structured Blocked Response Format** - JSON schema that agents should return when blocked, enabling orchestrators to route appropriately
- **"Spawn next agent" guidance** in Escalation Protocol - clarifies when to auto-route vs escalate to user

### Changed
- Enhanced "If blocked" instruction to reference routing table instead of generic "escalate to user"
- Added note to Escalation Protocol establishing this skill as single source of truth for routing logic
- Added `blocked_reason: "unknown"` as explicit user escalation trigger

### Context
Research on multi-agent architecture (Anthropic's official docs) confirms:
1. Only orchestrators should spawn agents, not subordinate agents
2. Escalation/routing logic belongs in orchestrator skills, not in agent definitions
3. Agents should return structured status and let orchestrators decide next steps

This update enables removing "## Escalation Protocol" sections from 29 individual agent definitions, centralizing routing logic here.
