# Changelog

All notable changes to this skill.

## [Date: 2025-12-25]

### Changed
- **Threshold lowered from ≥3 to ≥2 tasks** - TodoWrite now required for 2+ separate actions
- Updated complexity trigger: "≥3 distinct steps" → "≥2 distinct steps" (line 17)
- Updated don't use condition: "<3 steps" → "<2 steps" and "1-2 steps" → "1 step" (line 32)
- Updated decision flowchart: "Is this ≥3 steps?" → "Is this ≥2 steps?" (lines 110, 406)
- Updated minimum tasks guideline: "Minimum: 3 tasks" → "Minimum: 2 tasks" (line 422)

### Reason
- **RED failure**: User reports agents get lost even with 2 tasks
- **Empirical evidence**: Agents experience context drift and lose track with just 2 separate actions
- **Current threshold too high**: ≥3 allows failures in 2-task scenarios
- **Fix**: Lower complexity trigger to catch 2-task scenarios that need TodoWrite tracking

### Impact
- ✅ Agents will now use TodoWrite for 2+ task scenarios
- ✅ Reduces context drift in simple 2-task operations
- ✅ Better prevents agents from losing track of progress
- ⚠️ Slightly increases TodoWrite usage (but prevents failures)

### REFACTOR Phase Documentation

**Pressure Test Scenarios:**

1. **Time Pressure**: "Just 2 tasks, can skip TodoWrite"
   - ❌ NO - 2 tasks triggers ≥2 threshold
   - ✅ Explicit mandate: "≥2 distinct steps" requires TodoWrite

2. **Authority Rationalization**: "2 tasks is too simple for TodoWrite"
   - ❌ NO - User reports agents get lost with 2 tasks
   - ✅ Empirical evidence supports ≥2 threshold

3. **Sunk Cost**: "Already started without TodoWrite"
   - ❌ NO - Must initialize TodoWrite before any work
   - ✅ "BEFORE starting" language enforced

**Test Results:**
- ✅ All 5 edits applied consistently (lines 17, 32, 110, 406, 422)
- ✅ Threshold lowered from ≥3 to ≥2 across all references
- ✅ Compliance passed (line count, audit)
- ✅ No functionality lost, improves tracking coverage
