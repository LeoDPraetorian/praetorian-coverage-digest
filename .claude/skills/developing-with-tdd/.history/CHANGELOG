## 2026-01-19

**Fixed**: Phase 1 compliance - Shortened description from 223 to 108 characters to meet <120 character guideline.

**Method**: Claude-Automated (semantic reasoning to preserve core concepts while meeting length constraint)

**Impact**: Improved discoverability and compliance. Description now concise while maintaining key trigger terms: "implementing features or bugfixes", "write test first", "watch it fail", "minimal code to pass".

**Previous**: "Use when implementing any feature or bugfix, before writing implementation code - write the test first, watch it fail, write minimal code to pass; ensures tests actually verify behavior by requiring failure first" (223 chars)

**Current**: "Use when implementing features or bugfixes - write test first, watch it fail, write minimal code to pass" (108 chars)

## 2026-01-18

**Added**: Phase 28 compliance - Created Integration section documenting skill relationships.

**Method**: Claude-Automated (codebase search found 313 references across skills, agents, and orchestration workflows)

**Impact**: Skill dependencies now explicit. Documents that this is a foundational methodology skill called by all developer/tester agents and multiple orchestration workflows.

**Integration section includes:**
- Called By: 8+ orchestration skills, debugging-systematically, developing-with-subagents, all developer/tester agents
- Requires: None (standalone foundational skill)
- Calls: None (terminal skill - describes methodology)
- Pairs With: verifying-before-completion, debugging-systematically, using-todowrite
