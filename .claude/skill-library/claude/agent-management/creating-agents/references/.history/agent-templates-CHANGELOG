# Changelog - agent-templates.md

## 2025-12-29

### Changed
- **CRITICAL FIX**: Rewritten to match actual gold standard agents
- Changed Skill Loading Protocol from "Tier 1/2/3" to "Step 1/2/3"
- Added Core Responsibilities section template (2-4 subsections)
- Fixed two-tier skill system documentation (Skill tool for core, Read for library)
- Updated output format to use skills_invoked + library_skills_read (two arrays)
- Expanded Anti-Bypass from 3 brief points to 5-6 detailed points with explanations
- Updated line count targets to realistic ranges by agent type (150-280 lines)
- Added 4 gold standard agent references (frontend-lead, frontend-tester, security-lead, frontend-developer)
- Enhanced type-specific customizations with detailed guidance per agent type
- Added comprehensive examples for Architecture, Development, Testing, and Quality agents

### Why
The template had DRIFTED from actual gold standard agents and contained WRONG information:
- Instructed "Use Read() for ALL skills" (WRONG - two-tier system)
- Showed single "skills_read" array (WRONG - should be skills_invoked + library_skills_read)
- Referenced unrealistic line count target (<150 lines)
- Missing Core Responsibilities section
- Insufficient Anti-Bypass guidance

This caused all new agents created from the template to not match the gold standard pattern.

### Impact
- New agents created using this template will now match gold standard structure
- Agents will properly document the two-tier skill loading system
- Output formats will use correct JSON structure
- Line count expectations align with reality

### Line Count
- Before: 180 lines
- After: 306 lines (+126 lines of corrected guidance)
