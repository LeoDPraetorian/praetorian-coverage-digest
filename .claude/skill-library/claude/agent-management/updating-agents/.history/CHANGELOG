# Changelog - updating-agents

## 2025-12-29

### Changed
- **CRITICAL FIX**: Section 3.3 completely rewritten to reflect ACTUAL gold standard patterns
- Changed from "Tier 1/2/3" to "Step 1/2/3" throughout
- Added Section 3.3.1: Two-tier skill system documentation (Skill tool for core, Read for library)
- Rewrote Section 3.3.2: Step 1/2/3 structure with correct table formats
- Updated Section 3.3.3: Anti-Bypass now correctly specifies 5-6 detailed points (not "3 brief")
- Added Section 3.3.4: Output format with skills_invoked + library_skills_read (two separate arrays)
- Updated Section 3.3.5: Verification checks for correct tool usage patterns
- Fixed Section 6.3 title: "Universal Step 1 Skills Check" (was "Universal Tier 1 Skills Check")
- Updated Section 6.5 manual checks to reference Step 1/2/3 and correct output format

### Why
Section 3.3 contained FACTUALLY INCORRECT information that would cause agents to be updated incorrectly:
- Specified "Tier 1/2/3" structure - WRONG (gold standard uses Step 1/2/3)
- Said "Use Read() for ALL skills" - WRONG (two-tier: Skill tool for core, Read for library)
- Specified single "skills_read" array - WRONG (two arrays: skills_invoked + library_skills_read)
- Said "3 bullet points" for Anti-Bypass - WRONG (should be 5-6 detailed points)

This caused developers updating agents to use incorrect patterns that don't match actual gold standard agents.

### Impact
- Developers will now update agents to match the correct gold standard pattern
- Section 3.3 provides comprehensive guidance aligned with frontend-lead, frontend-tester, security-lead
- Verification steps check for correct tool usage (Skill tool + Read tool)
- Manual checklists validate correct structure

### Line Count
- Before: 531 lines
- After: 569 lines (+38 lines of correct guidance)

### Verification
All claims in Section 3.3 are now verifiable against actual gold standard agents in `.claude/agents/`.
