# Verification - Validating Draft Quality

**Goal**: Ensure technical accuracy, voice consistency, and narrative coherence.

## Verification Dimensions

### 1. Technical Accuracy
- Code examples (syntax, APIs, commands)
- Technical claims against source
- File paths and commands
- Limitations honestly stated
- Links functional

**Method**: Read source code, test commands, check documentation

### 2. Voice Consistency
- Tone matches across sections
- Technical depth appropriate
- Personality markers present
- No generic blog phrases

**Method**: Compare each section to voice profile

### 3. Research Attribution
- Prior work cited
- Credits accurate
- Links included
- No plagiarism

**Method**: Verify URLs, check quotations, ensure credits clear

### 4. Narrative Flow
- Clear progression
- Smooth transitions
- Concepts ordered correctly
- Conclusion ties to intro

**Method**: Read straight through without stopping

### 5. Completeness
- User requirements covered
- Key points included
- Research incorporated
- Examples sufficient

**Method**: Check against original requirements

## Verification Workflow

**Pass 1**: Technical accuracy (facts, code, claims)
**Pass 2**: Voice consistency (tone, style, personality)
**Pass 3**: Narrative flow (progression, transitions)
**Pass 4**: Completeness (requirements, coverage)

## Quick Verification (Time-Constrained)

**Priority order**:
1. Technical Accuracy (NEVER skip)
2. Voice Consistency (Critical for authenticity)
3. Narrative Flow (Can be caught by readers)
4. Completeness (User feedback reveals gaps)

**Minimum viable**: Pass 1 (technical) + quick scan for voice violations
