## 2026-01-10 - Add Completion Skills Section

**Type**: Enhancement (structural)

**Changes**:
- Added new "Completion Skills" section after "Skill Priority" (line 76-98)
- Added mandate to invoke `verifying-before-completion` before claiming completion
- Added completion trap examples (wrong vs right patterns)
- Added 2 new red flags to Red Flags table:
  - "I'm done, no need to verify" → Completion claims require evidence
  - "Tests pass so requirements met" → Tests ≠ requirements

**Rationale**: Agents were claiming tasks complete without verification (e.g., "I updated all 118 files. Done!"). This creates a loophole where completion bypasses the verification skill that exists specifically for this purpose.

**Impact**: +24 lines (86 → 110 lines, well under 500-line limit)
