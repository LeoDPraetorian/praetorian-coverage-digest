# Changelog: gateway-frontend

## 2026-01-15

### Added
- Added `using-eslint` skill routing to Intent Detection table with triggers: "lint" / "eslint" / "code quality" / "before commit"
- Created new "Code Quality" section in Skill Registry with `using-eslint` entry
- Path: `.claude/skill-library/development/frontend/using-eslint/SKILL.md`

### Context
- ESLint issues were being generated by frontend-developer and not caught by frontend-reviewer
- `using-eslint` library skill existed but had no routing from gateway-frontend
- This update enables agents to discover and invoke ESLint checks before completion
