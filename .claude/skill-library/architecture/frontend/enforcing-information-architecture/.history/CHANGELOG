# Changelog

## [Date: 2025-12-23]

### Added
- New section "Code Structure Standards" after Overview section
- Reference file `references/code-structure-standards.md` with detailed patterns:
  - Import Order (Strict) - 4 groups with blank line separation
  - File Length Limits (Hard) - Components <300, Functions <30, Hooks <50
  - Component Internal Structure - Mandatory ordering of types, constants, hooks
- Quick reference table in SKILL.md summarizing standards

### Changed
- SKILL.md updated from 419 to 439 lines (added 20 lines for summary section)
- Content organized using progressive disclosure (detailed patterns in reference file)

### Reason
- Gap identified: Skill covered file/directory organization but lacked code-level structure standards
- Developers needed guidance on import order, file length limits, and component internal structure
- Adding inline would exceed 500 line hard limit (419 + 90 = ~509)
- Solution: Extract detailed content to reference, keep concise summary in main skill

### REFACTOR Phase
- Verified discoverability: Section appears early with clear heading and table
- Verified actionability: Hard limits stated explicitly with violation examples
- Verified bypass resistance: "Hard limits" and "mandatory" language used
- No significant bypass risks for content addition (vs rule modification)
- Conclusion: PASSED
