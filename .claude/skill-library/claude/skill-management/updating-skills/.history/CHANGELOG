### Changed
- Added Phase 2.3: Mandatory line count check with size strategy decision
- Split Phase 4 into Phase 4a (Extract to References) and Phase 4b (Inline Edit)
- Enhanced Phase 7.2 with HARD LIMIT enforcement (fails if >500 lines)
- Updated Quick Reference table to reflect new phases and timing
- Added decision matrix for line count thresholds (350/400/500)
- Added AskUserQuestion for size strategy when >400 lines or adding >50 lines

### Reason
- Agents were ignoring progressive disclosure instructions, causing SKILL.md files to bloat beyond 500 lines
- Progressive disclosure was positioned as optional cleanup rather than mandatory workflow
- Line count check happened too late (after content written), making extraction feel like rework
- No enforcement mechanism - agents could rationalize away the 500 line limit
- Fixed by making size check mandatory upfront (Phase 2.3) with forced decision before editing

### Impact
- Progressive disclosure is now enforced as gatekeeper, not suggestion
- Size strategy must be decided before any editing
- Hard limit at 500 lines with script that exits on failure
- Extraction workflow (4a) is now equal to inline workflow (4b), not an exception
- Cannot skip size check - it's a TodoWrite checkpoint
