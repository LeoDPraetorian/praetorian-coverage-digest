# Searching Skills

**Keyword-based skill discovery across core and library locations.**

> **You MUST use TodoWrite** before starting to track all search workflow steps.

---

## What This Skill Does

Searches for skills by keyword across:

- ✅ Core skills (`.claude/skills/`)
- ✅ Library skills (`.claude/skill-library/`)
- ✅ Fuzzy matching on name and description
- ✅ Scored results (exact > substring > fuzzy)

---

## When to Use

- Finding skills by keyword ("React", "testing", "audit")
- Discovering available skills before creating duplicates
- Exploring skill library organization
- Locating skills for reference

**NOT for:**

- Listing all skills (use `listing-skills`)
- Creating skills (use `creating-skills`)
- Auditing skills (use `auditing-skills`)

---

## Quick Search

**Simple search:**

```typescript
Grep {
  pattern: "keyword",
  path: ".claude",
  output_mode: "files_with_matches"
}

// Filter for SKILL.md files
// Show skill name from path
```

**Enhanced search with scoring:**

1. Name exact match: 100 points
2. Name substring: 50 points
3. Description match: 30 points
4. Path match: 10 points

---

## Step 1: Navigate to Repository Root (MANDATORY)

**Execute BEFORE any search operation:**

```bash
ROOT="$(git rev-parse --show-superproject-working-tree --show-toplevel | head -1)" && cd "$ROOT"
```

**⚠️ If skill file not found:** You are in the wrong directory. Navigate to repo root first. The file exists, you're just looking in the wrong place.

**Cannot proceed without navigating to repo root** ✅

---

## Workflow

Follow these steps to search for skills by keyword with scoring and result formatting:

### Step 2: Get Search Query

If user provided query, use it. Otherwise, ask:

```typescript
Question: What are you searching for?
Header: Search Query
Options:
  - Keyword (e.g., "React", "testing")
  - Skill name fragment
  - Domain (e.g., "frontend", "backend")
```

### Step 3: Search Core Skills

**Search core skill names:**

```bash
ls .claude/skills/ | grep -i "keyword"
```

**Search core descriptions:**

```typescript
Grep {
  pattern: "keyword",
  path: ".claude/skills",
  glob: "**/SKILL.md",
  output_mode: "content",
  "-i": true
}
```

### Step 4: Search Library Skills

**Search library skill names:**

```typescript
Glob {
  pattern: "**/*keyword*/SKILL.md",
  path: ".claude/skill-library"
}
```

**Search library descriptions:**

```typescript
Grep {
  pattern: "keyword",
  path: ".claude/skill-library",
  glob: "**/SKILL.md",
  output_mode: "content",
  "-i": true
}
```

### Step 5: Score and Sort Results

For each match:

- Extract skill name from path
- Read SKILL.md for description
- Calculate score
- Sort by score descending

### Step 6: Format Output

```text
Search Results for "{keyword}":

[CORE] skill-name (Score: 100)
  Location: .claude/skills/skill-name
  Description: {first line of description}
  → Use: skill: "skill-name"

[LIB] another-skill (Score: 50)
  Location: .claude/skill-library/category/another-skill
  Description: {first line}
  → Read: .claude/skill-library/category/another-skill/SKILL.md

Found {count} matches
```

---

## Example Searches

**Search: "react"**

```text
[LIB] creating-skills (Score: 30)
  Description mentions React in examples

[LIB] using-tanstack-query (Score: 50)
  Category contains React patterns

[LIB] using-modern-react-patterns (Score: 100)
  Name exact match
```

**Search: "test"**

```text
[CORE] pressure-testing-skill-content (Score: 100)
[LIB] frontend-unit-test-engineer (Score: 50)
[LIB] backend-tester (Score: 50)
```

## Integration

### Called By

- `managing-skills` skill (search operation routing)
- `/skill-manager search <query>` command
- Gateway skills (when user asks "find skills about X")
- Users discovering available skills before creating duplicates

### Requires (invoke before starting)

None - standalone search skill

### Calls (during execution)

None - terminal skill (doesn't invoke other skills)

### Pairs With (conditional)

| Skill             | Trigger                          | Purpose                              |
| ----------------- | -------------------------------- | ------------------------------------ |
| `listing-skills`  | When complete enumeration needed | List all skills instead of searching |
| `creating-skills` | After search finds no match      | Create new skill if missing          |
| `auditing-skills` | After finding skill to validate  | Validate discovered skill            |
