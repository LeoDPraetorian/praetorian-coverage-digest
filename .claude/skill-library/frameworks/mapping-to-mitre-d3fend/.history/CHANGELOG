# Changelog

## 2026-01-06 - Initial Creation

**Type:** Library skill (Framework/Reference)
**Category:** frameworks/
**Created by:** Nathan (via creating-skills workflow)

### RED Phase Documentation

**Gap Identified:**
Capability developers at Chariot detect vulnerabilities and map them to MITRE ATT&CK techniques, but security findings are incomplete without remediation guidance. Teams need to know which defensive techniques counter specific ATT&CK techniques, how to prioritize defensive controls, and what security architecture changes to recommend.

**Test Scenario (RED - Expected to Fail):**
"I detected T1059.001 (PowerShell execution) being exploited. What MITRE D3FEND defensive techniques should I recommend to prevent this attack?"

**Expected Failure Without Skill:**
Claude provides generic responses like "use application whitelisting" or "disable PowerShell" without recognizing these map to specific D3FEND techniques:
- D3-PSA (Process Spawn Analysis)
- D3-SCA (Script Content Analysis)
- D3-EAL (Execution Application Allow Listing)

**Failure Indicators:**
1. No standardized D3FEND technique IDs
2. Missing ATT&CK → D3FEND mapping tables
3. No decision framework for selecting defensive controls
4. Missing CWE → ATT&CK → D3FEND integration chain

### Skill Structure

**Location:** `.claude/skill-library/frameworks/mapping-to-mitre-d3fend/`

**Contents:**
- `SKILL.md` (403 lines) - Main reference with D3FEND taxonomy, ATT&CK-to-D3FEND mappings, decision trees
- `references/` - Prepared for detailed reference files
- `examples/` - Prepared for example mappings

**Skill Type:** Library/Framework (defensive countermeasure framework)

**Target Audience:** Capability developers writing remediation guidance for security findings

### Initial Content

Skill includes:
- Six D3FEND defense categories (Model, Harden, Detect, Isolate, Deceive, Evict)
- ATT&CK-to-D3FEND mapping tables for common techniques
- Quick reference tables for Cloud, Network, Application, Credential security
- Decision trees for defense category selection
- Remediation template with priority guidance
- Code integration patterns for Tabularium findings
- Defense-in-depth approach with multiple defenses
- Cost-benefit analysis of defense categories

### Completion Status

**Phases Completed:**
- ✅ Phase 0-5: Skill structure created (403 lines, <500 limit)
- ✅ Phase 6: Research skipped (comprehensive initial content from knowledge base)
- ✅ Phase 7: Gateway integration (gateway-capabilities)
- ✅ Phase 8: GREEN verification passed
- ⏭️ Phase 9: REFACTOR (deferred to future iteration)

### Gateway Integration (Phase 7)

**Gateway Added:** `gateway-capabilities`
- Added to Intent Detection table with triggers: "D3FEND" / "defensive technique" / "remediation" / "countermeasure" / "defensive control"
- Added to Security Framework Mapping section in Skill Registry
- Placed alongside `mapping-to-cwe`, `mapping-to-sans-top-25`, `mapping-to-mitre-attack`

### GREEN Phase Verification (Phase 8)

**Test Scenario:** "I detected T1059.001 (PowerShell execution) being exploited. What MITRE D3FEND defensive techniques should I recommend?"

**Skill Performance:**
✅ ATT&CK-to-D3FEND mapping table shows: T1059.001 → D3-SCA (Script Content Analysis) primary, D3-PSA and D3-EAL secondary
✅ Provides specific D3FEND technique IDs (not generic "block PowerShell")
✅ Defense-in-depth approach with multiple techniques
✅ Implementation guidance in quick reference tables

**Result:** PASS - Skill correctly identifies D3-SCA (Script Content Analysis), D3-PSA (Process Spawn Analysis), and D3-EAL (Execution Application Allow Listing) instead of generic defensive advice.

**Skill Ready for Use:** Yes - capability developers can now use this skill for defensive technique mapping and remediation guidance
