# Projects are NOT listed here because:
# 1. Absolute paths are user-specific and won't work across machines
# 2. Path-based routing (2026-01-04 fix) auto-registers projects on first use
# 3. This allows the config to be version-controlled and shared
#
# Projects will be auto-registered when accessed via semantic routing.
# See: .claude/docs/mcps/SERENA-ARCHITECTURE.md
# NOTE: Do not add absolute paths here - they won't work on other machines.
# Path-based routing auto-registers projects on first use.
