### Changed
- **CRITICAL FIX**: Phase 9 completely rewritten to validate ACTUAL gold standard patterns
- Changed Phase 9 purpose from "Tiered Skill Loading Protocol" to "Step 1/2/3 Skill Loading Protocol"
- Added Phase 9 Step 2: Check for two-tier skill system documentation (Skill tool + Read tool)
- Updated Phase 9 Step 3: Check for Step 1/2/3 structure (NOT Tier 1/2/3)
- Updated Phase 9 Step 5: Check for skills_invoked + library_skills_read (two arrays)
- Added Phase 9 Step 6: Check for Core Responsibilities section with 2-4 subsections
- Updated Phase 9 results to include errors for all incorrect patterns

### Why
Phase 9 was checking for WRONG patterns:
- Checked for "Tier 1/2/3" - WRONG (gold standard uses Step 1/2/3)
- Checked for single "skills_read" array - WRONG (gold standard uses two arrays)
- Did not check for two-tier skill system documentation - MISSING
- Did not check for Core Responsibilities section - MISSING

This would cause correctly-structured agents (matching gold standard) to fail audit, while incorrectly-structured agents would pass.

### Impact
- Phase 9 now validates the actual gold standard agent pattern
- Agents matching frontend-lead, frontend-tester, security-lead will pass
- Agents using old Tier 1/2/3 pattern will correctly fail
- Core Responsibilities section is now validated
- Two-tier skill system documentation is now validated

### Line Count
- Before: 1465 lines
- After: 1487 lines (+22 lines of correct validation)

### Verification
All checks in Phase 9 are now aligned with actual gold standard agents in `.claude/agents/`.
