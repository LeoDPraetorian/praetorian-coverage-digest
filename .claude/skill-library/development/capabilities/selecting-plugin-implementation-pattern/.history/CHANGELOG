## 2026-01-06 - Initial Creation

**RED Phase Documentation:**

**Gap Identified**: Developers building security capabilities lack guidance on when to use YAML template-based detection (Nuclei templates, Augustus) versus Go plugin-based detection (fingerprintx, janus capabilities).

**Test Scenario**: Developer needs to create admin panel detection capability - should they use YAML or Go?

**Failure Without Skill**:
- No systematic decision framework → arbitrary choice
- Missing critical factors (maintainer persona, community contributions, iteration speed)
- No awareness of hybrid approaches (JavaScript protocol, flow field)
- Potential anti-patterns (over-engineering simple tasks, under-engineering complex ones)

**Category**: development/capabilities (library skill)

**Skill Type**: Process/Pattern (decision framework and routing skill)

**Initial Implementation**:
- Decision matrix comparing YAML vs Go across 7 criteria
- Decision tree for systematic evaluation
- Detailed criteria tables for both approaches
- Hybrid approaches documentation (Nuclei v3 features)
- Chariot-specific module guidance
- Anti-patterns to avoid
- Common scenario walkthroughs (5 examples)
- Routes to implementing-yaml-template-engines or implementing-detection-plugins

**Line Count**: 351 lines (within 300-450 ideal range)

**Pressure Test Results** (Phase 9):
- Test 1 (Time Pressure): ✅ PASSED - Correctly chose Go plugin (fingerprintx) for Redis protocol detection
- Test 2 (Authority Pressure): ✅ PASSED - Correctly chose Go plugin (fingerprintx) for MongoDB protocol detection despite authority bias
- Test 3 (Sunk Cost Pressure): ✅ PASSED - Correctly evaluated YAML (Nuclei v3) vs Go, chose YAML based on deadline + sufficiency (not sunk cost avoidance)

All three tests demonstrated proper decision framework application under realistic pressure scenarios.
