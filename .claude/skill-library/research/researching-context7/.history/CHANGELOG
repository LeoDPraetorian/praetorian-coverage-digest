# Changelog - researching-context7

## 2025-12-30 - Initial Creation

**Type**: Library skill (process/research methodology)
**Category**: claude/skill-management
**Location**: .claude/skill-library/claude/skill-management/researching-context7

**RED Phase Documentation**:

**Gap**: When creating skills for npm libraries/frameworks (TanStack Query, Zustand, Zod, etc.), Claude agents either:
1. Hallucinate outdated API patterns from stale training data (12-18 months old)
2. Use web search which returns scattered, inconsistent documentation
3. Skip research entirely ("I already know this") and create skills with deprecated patterns

**Failure Scenario**: Agent asked to create a skill for TanStack Query v5 without Context7:
- Uses v4 API patterns from training data (queryCache.setQueryData instead of queryClient.setQueryData)
- Misses breaking changes in v5 (removed QueryCache export, changed hook signatures)
- Creates skill with outdated patterns that fail when users try them
- No version awareness or migration guidance

**Need**: Structured workflow for fetching official, indexed, versioned documentation from Context7 MCP service with quality indicators (✅ Recommended, ⚠️ Caution, ❌ Deprecated) to ensure authoritative, current API patterns.

**Features**:
- 6-phase workflow: Library Identification → Search → Confirmation → Fetch → Analysis → Synthesis
- Quality indicator system for package selection (main vs -core/-internal variants)
- Conditional user confirmation for multiple/ambiguous packages
- Structured synthesis output format for skill creation
- Fallback strategy when Context7 unavailable
- Integration with MCP wrappers (.claude/tools/context7/)

**Structure**:
- SKILL.md: 369 lines (✅ under 500-line limit)
- Progressive disclosure with 4 reference files planned
- Related to: researching-skills (orchestrator), researching-protocols, researching-arxiv (siblings)

**Next Steps**:
- Create reference files (context7-tools.md, quality-indicators.md, troubleshooting.md, documentation-analysis.md)
- Research population using researching-skills workflow
- GREEN phase: Test with TanStack Query v5 skill creation scenario
- REFACTOR phase: Pressure test with subagents
