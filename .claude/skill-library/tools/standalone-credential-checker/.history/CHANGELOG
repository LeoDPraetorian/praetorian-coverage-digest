## 2026-02-02 - Initial Creation

### Phase 1: RED (Gap Analysis)
**Gap Identified:** Existing `hibp-check` skill requires frumentarii CLI tool. Users need standalone API-based credential checking using curl/bash without external binaries.

**RED Test:** User wants to check credentials against HIBP/DeHashed but doesn't have frumentarii installed.

### Skill Details
- **Location:** Library skill (.claude/skill-library/tools/)
- **Category:** tools/
- **Type:** Tool Wrapper
- **Gateway:** gateway-integrations

### Initial Structure
- SKILL.md: 435 lines (reduced from 906)
- references/hibp-api-reference.md: 361 lines
- references/dehashed-api-reference.md: 499 lines
- references/batch-processing-patterns.md: 524 lines

### Key Features
- Direct curl commands for HIBP k-anonymity protocol
- DeHashed password search (free) and rich search (1 credit)
- API key pattern filtering (compatible with hibp-check logic)
- No external dependencies (curl + bash only)
- Complete error handling and rate limit guidance

### Integration
- Added to gateway-integrations routing table
- Triggers: HIBP, DeHashed, credential check, breach check, curl API calls
