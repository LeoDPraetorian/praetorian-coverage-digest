## [Date: 2026-01-10] - Fix Path and Session Variable Inconsistencies

### Changed
- Line 50: Replaced `.claude/.threat-model/{session-id}` with `.claude/.output/threat-modeling/{timestamp}-{slug}` in mkdir command
- Line 51: Replaced `.claude/.threat-model/{session-id}` with `.claude/.output/threat-modeling/{timestamp}-{slug}` in cd command

### Rationale
- Standardizes output directory path with threat-modeling-orchestrator skill conventions
- Uses consistent session identifier format matching persisting-agent-outputs skill
- Aligns with established `.claude/.output/` convention for orchestrator outputs
- Prevents confusion between old and new path conventions

### Line Count
- 335 lines (unchanged - well under 500 limit)

## [Date: 2025-12-18] - Initial Creation

### Created
- Skill created via creating-skills workflow
- RED failure documented: Threat modeling workflow lacked business context discovery (Phase 0), producing technically sound but business-blind threat models
- Category: security
- Type: process/pattern
- Lines: 331 (safe - under 500 limit)

### Context
- Part of threat modeling architecture enhancement
- Implements PASTA Stage 1 ("Define Objectives")
- Feeds business context to Phases 1-4 of threat modeling workflow
- Enables risk-based (not just technical) threat modeling
