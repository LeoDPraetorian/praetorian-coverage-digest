## 2025-12-29 - Initial Creation

**RED Phase Documentation:**

**Gap Identified:** The JANUS-RETIREMENT.md document proposes creating a Capability SDK as a separate repository to enable standalone tool execution and Chariot integration. However, there's a simpler alternative: use a Claude skill to generate Chariot integration code for standalone tools on-demand.

**Current Failure Behavior:**
Without this skill, integrating standalone security tools with Chariot requires:
- Manual writing of 3-4 Go files (capability.go, adapter.go, parser.go, init.go)
- Deep understanding of Tabularium Capability interface (~20 methods)
- Knowledge of how to map tool-specific outputs to Tabularium models
- Risk of inconsistent patterns across different capability integrations
- High barrier prevents PS operators from wrapping tools themselves

**Benefits of Skill Approach:**
- No SDK repository to maintain
- No version compatibility issues between SDK and tools
- Per-tool customized adapters (not generic)
- Claude handles edge cases automatically
- Zero Tabularium exposure for tool authors

**Category:** development/capabilities (Library skill)
**Skill Type:** Process/Pattern
**Line Count:** 379 lines

**Structure Created:**
- SKILL.md with progressive disclosure
- references/ for detailed workflows
- templates/ for code generation templates
- examples/ for integration examples
