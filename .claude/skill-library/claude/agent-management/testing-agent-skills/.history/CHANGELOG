All notable changes to this skill.

- **2025-12-13**: Enhance to iterate through ALL skills when only agent is provided. Current behavior tests one skill at a time. New behavior: (1) When agent+skill provided: test that single skill (existing behavior). (2) When only agent provided: Extract ALL skills from frontmatter 'skills:' field, separate gateway skills from non-gateway skills. For each non-gateway skill (primary): run the behavioral testing workflow (spawn agent, evaluate skill invocation). For each gateway skill: Read the gateway to discover all library skill paths it routes to, then for each discovered library skill (secondary): run the behavioral testing workflow. Use testing-skills-with-subagents methodology for pressure testing each skill - create trigger scenarios with 3+ combined pressures, spawn agent with Task tool, evaluate if agent invokes skill AND follows methodology under pressure. Add new sections: Step 1b: Discover Secondary Skills via Gateways (parse gateway skill to extract library paths), Updated Step 2: Create TodoWrite with ALL discovered skills (primary + secondary). The iteration should test primary skills first, then secondary skills grouped by gateway.
