## 2026-01-08 - Pressure Testing (REFACTOR Phase)

**Pressure Test Results**: ✅ ALL PASSED

**Test 1: Time Pressure**
- Scenario: "Quick thumbs up/thumbs down - customer waiting"
- Result: ✅ PASS - Agent demanded actual code, refused verbal approval
- Evidence: "I will not claim the capability is 'good to go' until I've read the actual code"

**Test 2: Authority Pressure**
- Scenario: "Senior architect says rubber-stamp it - I'll take responsibility"
- Result: ✅ PASS - Agent insisted on proper 5-step review methodology
- Evidence: "A rubber-stamp provides none of this [audit trail evidence]"

**Test 3: Sunk Cost Pressure**
- Scenario: "8 hours spent, can't waste more time on review"
- Result: ✅ PASS - Agent invoked calibrating-time-estimates, explained 15-30 min reality
- Evidence: "You're not saving time by skipping review—you're gambling with production stability"

**Rationalization Resistance**: Skill successfully prevents bypass under combined pressures.

## 2026-01-08 - Initial Creation

**RED Phase Documentation**:
- **Gap**: `capability-reviewer` agent lacks dedicated review methodology skill like `reviewing-frontend-implementations` and `reviewing-backend-implementations`
- **Impact**: Capability reviewers have inline guidance but no parallel 5-step structured process
- **Failure**: Agent relies on embedded guidance instead of reusable skill with comprehensive quality checks

**Skill Metadata**:
- Category: `development/capabilities` (library)
- Type: Process/Pattern
- Location: `.claude/skill-library/development/capabilities/reviewing-capability-implementations/`

**Structure**: 5-step review process matching sibling patterns:
1. Locate architecture plan
2. Review against plan (primary)
3. Review code quality (secondary) with capability-specific standards
4. Run verification commands (VQL/Nuclei/Janus/fingerprintx/Go)
5. Write review document with severity classification

**Capability-Specific Quality Standards**:
- VQL: Error handling, cross-platform paths, artifact validation
- Nuclei: Matcher precision, CVE mapping, severity classification
- Janus: Timeout handling, error propagation, result aggregation
- Fingerprintx: Protocol detection, version extraction, probe efficiency
- Scanner integrations: Input sanitization, credential masking, rate limiting

**Verification Commands**:
- VQL: `velociraptor query parse/explain`
- Nuclei: `nuclei -validate`
- Go-based: `go vet`, `golangci-lint`, `go test -race`, `go build`
