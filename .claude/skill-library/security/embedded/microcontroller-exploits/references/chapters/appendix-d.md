### **D.1 Atmega, AT90 Backside FIB** {#app04.xhtml_app04_1 .h3}

Helfmeier et al. (2013) describes backside probing attacks against the
Atmega328P and AT90SC3232. These two chips use the same AVR core, but
the Atmega uses shallow trench isolation (STI) to separate transistors
for preventing current leakage, while the AT90 has a security mesh
across its top two metal layers.

In both chips, the authors were able to dig a trench through the
backside of the IC to expose the fuse bits, then set or clear a fuse by
tampering it with a focused ion beam (FIB). Changing the bits related to
readout protection then allowed the chip to be read externally.

Fuse locations are documented in the paper, as well as notes about how
the STI feature impacts the difficulty of the FIB trenching work. You
can find the approximate fuse locations in [Figure
D.1](#app04.xhtml_chDfig1).

### **D.2 GD32F130 QSPI Sniffing, Injection** {#app04.xhtml_app04_2 .h3}

The GD32F103, GD32F130, and some other clones of the STM32 are dual-die
devices with a flash memory die stacked on top of the CPU, connected by
a QSPI bus. In [Figure D.2](#app04.xhtml_chDfig2), you can see that the
two dice are wire-bonded directly to one another. The little one on top
is the memory chip, and the big one on the bottom is the CPU.

The semi-transparent view exposes internal structure without decapsulation, useful for identifying die position, bond wire layout, and package construction before performing invasive analysis. This non-destructive imaging technique helps plan subsequent delayering and probing attacks.

[]{#app04.xhtml_page_312 .pagebreak}Obermaier, Schink, and Moczek (2020)
documents sanding away the packaging to expose the bond wires connecting
the two dice, sniffing the 4MHz bus traffic with a logic analyzer,
reverse engineering some address and data scrambling, and then
reconstructing the firmware image. Additionally, they were able to
inject data faults into the bus to force a downgrade from RDP Level 2 to
Level 1 by introducing a single bit error. A downgrade all the way to
Level 0 can be caused by flipping two bits of the address.

### **D.3 STM32 Ultraviolet Downgrade** {#app04.xhtml_app04_3 .h3}

Most of Obermaier and Tatschner (2017) concerns a delightful bug in the
JTAG debugging of the STM32F0 family from [Chapter
10](#ch10.xhtml_ch10), which allows firmware to be extracted from RDP in
Level 1 with a custom JTAG debugger. Many of these chips are locked in
RDP Level 2, and the paper also considers ways to downgrade the chip
using live decapsulation and ultraviolet light. Garb and Obermaier
(2020) extends this, with concrete notes on the layout of flash memory
for laser fault injection on the STM32F0 series.

To recap what's explained in many different chapters of this book, RDP
Level 0 is entirely unlocked and Level 2 is entirely locked, allowing no
debugging. Level 1 is a middle ground, in which a debugger is allowed
but attaching the debugger disables access to flash memory. Because
debugger access can be so handy to an attacker, such as for placing
shellcode or for exploiting loopholes in the protection, a downgrade
from Level 2 is a very valuable thing to have.

The protection level is stored in option bytes as a pair of 16-bit words
named [RDP]{.literal} and [nRDP]{.literal}. These words have a fixed
value for Level 0 and a fixed value for Level 2, with *all* other values
being Level 1. So while we need a very specific value to drop to Level
0, flipping any single bit is sufficient to drop to Level 1.

Figure D.4: STM32F051 Flash Layout

[]{#app04.xhtml_page_314 .pagebreak}Knowing that ultraviolet light can
raise flash memory bits from 0 to 1, Obermaier functionally decapsulated
an STM32F051 and aimed UV-C light at it while repeatedly attempting to
attach a debugger. After a few hours, the debugger connected and a
single 0 bit of the [RDP]{.literal}/[nRDP]{.literal} option bytes had
flipped to a 1. Unfortunately, other bits of memory had also flipped, so
masking was necessary for an unlock with minimal damage to the rest of
memory. As with the PIC16 in [Chapter 19](#ch19.xhtml_ch19), the mask
might be made by painting the die directly with nail polish.

The obvious solution to bit damage is to mask off memory, but first we
need to know which physical region holds the option bytes. They filled
all of flash memory in an unlocked chip with zeroes, then repeatedly
re-read memory with a debugger as ultraviolet light spilled in past a
plastic mask. In effect, this turned the chip into an image sensor, and
all of the 1 bits indicated places of memory that were outside of the
masked area.

This revealed that the flash memory of the STM32F051 in [Figure
D.3](#app04.xhtml_chDfig3) has 1024-bit lines and 512-word lines,
organized into 32-bit columns of 32-bit lines. Bit lines are
perpendicular to the nearest edge of the chip, with the most significant
bits on the left side and the least on the right side. The option bytes
exist beneath wordline 0, with [RDP]{.literal} and [nRDP]{.literal} on
the right half of the flash cell region, as they are the lower halves of
32-bit words. [Figure D.4](#app04.xhtml_chDfig4) shows an approximate
layout of the flash bit columns and the RDP word location.

Their best solution was a moving plastic mask that would expose just the
bottom right edge of the flash memory. This achieved a few unlocks with
no damage to firmware and many unlocks with only a few hundred firmware
bits damaged, and a bitwise [AND]{.literal} of two damaged firmware
images is often sufficient to make one clean accurate image.

### []{#app04.xhtml_page_315 .pagebreak}**D.4 MT1335WE Kamikaze** {#app04.xhtml_app04_4 .h3}

The MC13224 from [Chapter 14](#ch14.xhtml_ch14) isn't the only
system-in-package (SiP) that combines a CPU chip without non-volatile
memory with a standard SPI flash chip.

MediaTek's MT1335WE can be found in DVD-ROM drives for the XBox 360,
where its firmware is responsible for distinguishing between commercial
discs and DVD-R discs that are made by a consumer DVD burner. Pirates
figured out that these could be patched to accept burned discs, *but
only if* the SPI flash of the MT1335WE were rewritten with patched
firmware. The complication is that the SPI flash chip is bonded
internally to the MT1335WE's package, so there are no external pins to
tap or packages to replace.

Write protection is implemented through the chip's !WP pin, just as if
it were in a separate package. To bypass this control, we might tap the
SPI flash chip's !WP pin through its bond wire. This is described in
sQuallen (2012), which cites Geremia and Carranzaf as collaborating on
the discovery.

The idea is that the bond wires shown in [Figure
D.6](#app04.xhtml_chDfig6) are consistently placed the same across
chips, even if the silk-screen labeling drifts a bit. It's therefore
possible to accurately hit a bond wire with a drill using the
positioning shown in [Figure D.5](#app04.xhtml_chDfig5), knowing that
the bit will eventually collide with the bond wire. If you look closely
at the second bond wire on the right side of the SPI flash, you'll see
that it has been cleanly cut in half by the drill.

To perform the unlock, the drill bit is loosely attached through a
pull-up resistor to the 3.3V pin. Early instructions suggested drawing a
line over the package five pins from the east side and eight pins down
from the north side, which is usually just southeast of the letter K in
"Mediatek." Later kits used a flex PCB as a stencil, with a small hold
to place the drill bit.

Diagram below illustrates quad-flat package layout with pins on all four sides, noting "5 Pins Over" on top edge and "8 Pins Down" on right edge. The exposed die through package window and pin count information aids in identifying attack points for voltage glitching, bus monitoring, or direct die probing.

Figure D.6: MT1335WE Bond Wires

[]{#app04.xhtml_page_317 .pagebreak}Slowly spinning the bit without much
pressure will dig through the packaging until the bond wire is reached,
while in the background a PC repeatedly attempts to rewrite the SPI
flash contents. This process fails at first, of course, because the
drill hasn't yet pulled the !WP line high, but eventually the drill
reaches the wire and the SPI flash is unlocked!

sQuallen also mentions an attack with the piezo-electric spark of a
grill lighter placed near the bond wire. As best I can tell, this is not
to perform the initial unlock but to sort of "drift" the high-impedance
input pin back to a high-voltage state. That allows a reprogramming
after the bond wire is cut, but without further drilling.

### **D.5 Xilinx XCKU040 Backside Laser Injection** {#app04.xhtml_app04_5 .h3}

Lohrke et al. (2018) describes an infrared laser stimulation attack
against the flip-chip packaged Xilinx XCKU040-1FBVA676, an FPGA with
encrypted bitstreams.

This 20 nm chip has its backside exposed on the package, and the
substrate of the chip is transparent to infrared light. This means that
photography of the chip die can be performed from *outside* the package,
*non-invasively*! See Huang (2022) for an equipment list if you'd like
to make your own backside photographs without decapsulation.

The XCKU040 is an FPGA whose bitstream is loaded at boot time from an
external memory chip. To protect this bitstream from duplication or
reverse engineering, it's encrypted with a key that is held either in
battery-backed SRAM (BBRAM) or in eFuses. BBRAM has the disadvantage of
requiring a backup battery, but it offers some extra security in that
invasive attacks []{#app04.xhtml_page_318 .pagebreak} that break the
backup power supply will also destroy the key, preventing its recovery.

So, realizing that the silicon backside is exposed and transparent to
infrared light, Lohrke used an infrared laser to strike SRAM cells in
the battery-backed region, graphing the power consumption at each point.
Sure enough, CMOS power leakage highlighted each bit cell in one
orientation for a 1 and the opposite orientation for a 0, revealing the
key!
