# Task: Merge CVSS Skills

**Created:** 2026-01-12

## Current State

Two CVSS scoring skills now exist:

1. **scoring-cvss-threats** (`.claude/skill-library/security/scoring-cvss-threats/`)
   - Purpose: Threat modeling Phase 3 CVSS scoring
   - Features: Temporal/Environmental metrics, business context integration from Phase 1
   - Focus: Prioritizing threats in threat modeling workflow

2. **scoring-cvss-findings** (`.claude/skill-library/security/scoring-cvss-findings/`)
   - Purpose: General CVSS scoring for findings/vulnerabilities
   - Features: Interactive calibration, conservative scoring, anti-patterns, decision trees
   - Focus: Avoiding over-inflation, clarifying questions, CVSSv3.1 & v4.0

## Proposed Merge Strategy

### Option 1: Combine into Single Skill

Merge both into `scoring-cvss-threats` with two modes:

```
Mode 1: Threat Modeling (existing workflow)
- Integrates with Phase 1 business context
- Temporal/Environmental metrics
- Used during threat modeling Phase 3

Mode 2: Finding Calibration (new workflow)
- Interactive clarifying questions
- Conservative scoring defaults
- Anti-patterns and inflation prevention
- Used for standalone findings/reports
```

### Option 2: Keep Separate, Add Cross-References

- Keep distinct skills for different use cases
- Add cross-references between them
- Update gateway routing for clearer differentiation

## Review Tasks

- [ ] Compare overlap in reference files (both have CVSS v3.1/v4.0 guidance)
- [ ] Identify duplicate content that can be consolidated
- [ ] Decide if conservative scoring guidance should be in threat modeling workflow
- [ ] Test both skills to understand real-world usage patterns
- [ ] Get user feedback on whether separate skills make sense

## Recommendation

**Defer decision** until:

1. Both skills have been used in real workflows
2. User feedback on which approach is more intuitive
3. Clear patterns emerge for when to use each

For now, keeping them separate is fine - they serve different purposes and different entry points.
