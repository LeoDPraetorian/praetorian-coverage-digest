# Changelog - testing-mcp-wrappers

## 2026-01-02 - Initial Creation

### Context
**Category**: Library skill (testing/)
**Skill Type**: Process/Pattern
**Location**: `.claude/skill-library/testing/testing-mcp-wrappers/`

### RED Phase: Gap Documentation
**Why this skill is needed:**
- MCP wrapper testing requires specialized patterns not covered by general testing skills
- gateway-testing needs a focused skill to route MCP Tester agents to
- Current testing skills don't address MCP-specific concerns: response filtering, token optimization, schema validation

**Test scenario without skill:**
MCP Tester agents would receive generic testing guidance from gateway-testing, missing critical MCP wrapper patterns:
- No guidance on when to use unit vs schema vs integration tests for wrappers
- No code examples for response filtering verification
- No token optimization testing patterns
- No Zod schema testing examples specific to MCP wrappers

**Expected behavior with skill:**
- Clear test mode selection (unit/schema/integration)
- Practical code examples for MCP-specific test scenarios
- Test implementation process aligned with test-lead workflows
- MCP wrapper test checklist for completion verification

### Content Summary
**Main sections:**
1. Test Mode Selection - When to use unit, schema, integration tests
2. MCP-Specific Test Patterns - Code examples for:
   - Response filtering verification
   - Token optimization measurement (80%+ reduction target)
   - Zod schema validation (valid/invalid/edge cases)
3. Test Implementation Process - Locate plan, implement, verify
4. MCP Wrapper Test Checklist - Completion criteria
5. Common Pitfalls - Anti-patterns with ❌/✅ examples
6. Test Infrastructure - Token counting, mocks, fixtures

**Line count:** 338 lines (well under 500 limit)

**References created:** None (all content in main SKILL.md)

### Research Phase
**Research decision:** Skipped - user provided comprehensive content in initial request

All content populated from user requirements:
- Test mode selection (unit/schema/integration)
- MCP-specific test patterns with code examples
- Test implementation process
- MCP wrapper test checklist
- Common pitfalls and anti-patterns
- Test infrastructure examples

### GREEN Phase Status
**Status:** ✅ PASSED

Audit results:
- No critical issues
- INFO-level issues: 2 (code block language tags, header hierarchy - acceptable)
- Compliance verified with `npm run audit -- testing-mcp-wrappers`
- Gateway updated: `gateway-testing` now routes MCP Tester agents to this skill

### REFACTOR Phase Status
**Status:** SKIPPED (user decision)

Can be conducted later with updating-skills workflow if pressure testing needed.
