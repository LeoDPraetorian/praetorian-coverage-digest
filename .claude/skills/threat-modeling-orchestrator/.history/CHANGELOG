## [Date: 2024-12-17] - Initial Creation

### Created
- Skill created via creating-skills workflow
- RED failure documented: Without orchestrator, threat modeling achieves ~5% completeness (ad-hoc, no structure, no phases, no state)
- Location: Core skill (.claude/skills/)
- Type: Process/Pattern

### Key Features
- Multi-phase workflow (4 phases)
- Parallel agent execution for large codebases
- Human checkpoints between all phases
- State persistence in .claude/.threat-model/{session}/
- Structured outputs (MD + JSON + SARIF)

### Dependencies
- codebase-mapping skill (Phase 1 methodology) - EXISTS
- codebase-mapper agent (Phase 1 executor) - EXISTS
- security-controls-mapping skill (Phase 2) - PENDING
- security-controls-mapper agent (Phase 2) - PENDING
- threat-modeling skill (Phase 3) - PENDING
- security-test-planning skill (Phase 4) - PENDING

## [Date: 2024-12-18] - Phase 0 Integration

### Changed
- Integrated Phase 0 (Business Context Discovery) into threat modeling workflow
- Added Phase 0 to Quick Reference table (now 5 phases: 0-4)
- Inserted Step 1.5: Phase 0 execution between scope selection and Phase 1
- Added Phase 0 enforcement rule (mandatory before Phase 1)
- Updated session setup to create phase-0/ directory
- Updated handoff protocol to include Phase 0 summary (crown jewels, compliance context)
- Added Phase 0 checkpoint template
- Updated session directory structure to include phase-0/
- Updated related skills to include business-context-discovery

### Reason
- RED failure: Orchestrator lacked Phase 0 invocation, producing technically accurate but business-blind threat models (security theater vs risk management)
- Cannot assess risk without business context (WHAT to protect, WHY it matters, WHO attacks)
- Phase 0 enables risk-based threat modeling by providing crown jewels, threat actors, business impact, and compliance requirements
- Integration plan: threat-model-business-integration.md Task 1

### Impact
- Line count: 341 → 425 lines (+84 lines, still in safe zone)
- Enables business-driven threat modeling (PASTA Stage 1 compliance)
- Phases 1-4 can now use business context for prioritization and risk scoring
- Next: Update Phases 1-4 skills to consume Phase 0 outputs (Tasks 2-5)

### REFACTOR
- Tests run: [Time+Authority+Emergency, Expertise+Pragmatic+Sunk Cost, Deadline+Client Service+Efficiency]
- Vulnerabilities found: 3 bypass scenarios (manager approval, previous Phase 0, "no sensitive data" claims)
- Counters added: "No exceptions" section with 6 explicit anti-rationalization rules
- Line count after hardening: 425 → 437 lines (+12 lines)
- Re-test result: **PASSED** - All three scenarios now explicitly countered
- Skill is bulletproof against Phase 0 bypass attempts
