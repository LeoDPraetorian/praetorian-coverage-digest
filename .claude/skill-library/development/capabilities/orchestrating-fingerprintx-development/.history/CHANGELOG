# Changelog

All notable changes to the orchestrating-fingerprintx-development skill will be documented in this file.

## [Update] - 2025-12-31

### Added

- **Phase 6: Testing** - New dedicated phase for writing unit tests
- Integration with writing-fingerprintx-tests skill (fourth coordinated skill)
- Testing checklist: table-driven tests, edge cases, parsing/validation/building tests
- Updated output artifacts to include {protocol}_test.go in plugin directory

### Changed

- Workflow expanded from 7 to 8 phases
- Renumbered: Phase 6 (Validation) → Phase 7, Phase 7 (Integration & PR) → Phase 8
- Coordinated skills: "three specialized skills" → "four specialized skills"
- TodoWrite tracking updated to include Phase 6 (testing)
- MySQL example walkthrough updated with Phase 6 testing step
- Output artifacts location now documents plugin directory structure

### Rationale

The writing-fingerprintx-tests skill was just created to ensure comprehensive unit test coverage for fingerprintx plugins. Previously, the orchestrator mentioned running tests in Validation but didn't enforce WRITING tests. This update makes test creation an explicit phase with its own checklist, ensuring proper test coverage before validation.

**GREEN Phase Verification**: With new Phase 6, the workflow now explicitly guides test creation using established patterns (table-driven, mocks, edge cases) before moving to validation.

## [Initial Creation] - 2025-12-30

### Added

- Initial creation of orchestrating-fingerprintx-development skill
- 7-phase workflow with enforced gates (Protocol Research, Version Marker Research)
- Integration with three sub-skills: researching-protocols, researching-version-markers, writing-fingerprintx-modules
- TodoWrite tracking for all phases
- Comprehensive gate enforcement with rationalization prevention
- Output artifact templates and persistence strategy
- Progressive disclosure with references/ for detailed content

### Context

**RED Phase Failure Documentation**:

Current state: Fingerprintx development uses three advisory skills that say "do X first" but don't ENFORCE the workflow.

Result without this orchestrator:
- Developers skip directly to implementation without protocol research
- Missing version detection because version marker research was skipped
- Imprecise CPEs (mysql:* instead of mysql:8.0.23)
- Failed plugins that don't handle edge cases
- Technical debt with ~10% fix rate

This orchestrator makes research BLOCKING - cannot proceed to implementation until research outputs exist and pass gate conditions.
