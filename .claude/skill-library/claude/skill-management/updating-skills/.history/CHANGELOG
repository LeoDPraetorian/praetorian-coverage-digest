## [2025-12-31] - Simplify Repository Root Navigation Pattern

### Changed
- **Step 0: Navigate to repo root** in SKILL.md - Replaced complex 3-line pattern with industry-standard single-line approach
- Old pattern: `REPO_ROOT=$(git rev-parse --show-superproject-working-tree 2>/dev/null); test -z "$REPO_ROOT" && REPO_ROOT=$(git rev-parse --show-toplevel); cd "$REPO_ROOT"`
- New pattern: `ROOT="$(git rev-parse --show-superproject-working-tree --show-toplevel | head -1)" && cd "$ROOT"`
- Variable name: `REPO_ROOT` → `ROOT` for consistency with commands and MCP tools

### Reason
- **RED failure**: Old pattern uses unnecessary complexity (stderr redirect, conditional test, 3 separate commands)
- Can cause parsing errors in Claude Code's Bash tool when combined with other operators
- Inconsistent with updated patterns across codebase (commands, MCP skills, CLAUDE.md)
- More verbose and harder to maintain than necessary

### Technical Details
- Single git command with both `--show-superproject-working-tree` and `--show-toplevel` flags
- Pipe to `head -1` automatically selects first non-empty result (super-repo root when in submodule)
- Simpler: 2 commands instead of 3, one line instead of three
- No stderr redirect needed, no conditional test needed
- Proper quoting prevents bash parsing errors
- Works identically from any directory depth (tested from super-repo and submodule)

### Files Changed
- `SKILL.md` lines 47-50 - Replaced navigation pattern with simplified approach
- Line count: 188 → 185 lines (3 lines removed due to consolidation)

### Verification
- ✅ Tested from submodule directory (`modules/chariot/ui/src/`) → Returns super-repo root
- ✅ Tested from super-repo root → Returns super-repo root
- ✅ No old pattern examples remain in `references/` subdirectory

## [2025-12-30] - Add Phase Numbering Rule

### Added
- **Step 3.6: Phase Numbering Rule (MANDATORY)** in SKILL.md - Prevents fractional phase numbering
- Detailed phase numbering guidance in `references/update-workflow.md` Phase 4b
- Explicit rule: NEVER use fractional phases (Phase 3.5, 5.4), ALWAYS renumber sequentially
- Example workflow showing renumbering process (Phase 4→5, 5→6, etc.)
- Guidance on updating ALL references to renumbered phases throughout skill

### Changed
- SKILL.md: Added Step 3.6 between Research (3.5) and Edit (4)
- `references/update-workflow.md`: Added Phase Numbering Rule as Step 2 in Phase 4b workflow
- Line count: 176 → 192 lines (still well under 500 limit)

### Reason
- **RED failure**: Claude has tendency to insert fractional phases (3.5, 5.4) instead of renumbering
- Existing instances found: `creating-skills` CHANGELOG references Phase 5.3, 5.4, 2.3
- `managing-skills/references/patterns/changelog-format.md` line 7 references Phase 5.4
- Fractional phases create maintenance debt and numbering confusion
- No explicit guidance existed to prevent this anti-pattern

### Technical Details
- Distinguishes between fractional MAJOR phases (bad) and sub-steps (acceptable)
- Sub-steps like Step 7.1, 7.2, 7.3 represent decomposition, not insertion
- Mandates updating cross-references when renumbering (search SKILL.md + references/)
- Position: After Research, before Edit (where phase additions would occur)

### Files Changed
- `SKILL.md` - Added Step 3.6 Phase Numbering Rule (~10 lines)
- `references/update-workflow.md` - Added Phase Numbering Rule in Phase 4b (~30 lines)

### Impact
- Prevents future fractional phase numbering in all skill updates
- Will require fixing existing fractional phases in creating-skills
- Coordinated with pending updates to auditing-skills and fixing-skills

### Method
- Manual edit via Edit tool
- Backup created: `.local/2025-12-30-*-updating-skills-pre-phase-numbering.bak`

---

## [2025-12-27] - Add Optional Research Integration

### Added
- **Research Integration (Optional)** section - Between Step 3 (Backup) and Step 4 (Edit)
- AskUserQuestion pattern to ask user if they want to invoke researching-skills
- Clear guidance on when to suggest research vs skip research
- Read() invocation path for researching-skills with what it provides

### Changed
- Added Step 3.5 to workflow (Research - Optional)
- Updated Related Skills to include researching-skills
- Line count: 99 → 155 lines (still well under 500 limit)

### Reason
- **RED failure**: No research guidance when updating library/framework skills (TanStack Query, Zustand, etc.)
- Updates often based on outdated knowledge (agent training data 12+ months old)
- Inconsistent with creating-skills (which mandates researching-skills in Phase 6)
- Phantom context7 feature documented in operations.md (`--refresh-context7`) that doesn't exist

### Technical Details
- Optional, not mandatory (unlike creating-skills where research is required)
- User-driven via AskUserQuestion (respects user judgment)
- Same skill, same patterns (leverages researching-skills exactly like creating-skills)
- Position: Between backup (protect file) and edit (make changes)

### Files Changed
- `SKILL.md` - Added Research Integration section (~56 lines)
- Fixed code block language tag (typescript) for compliance

### Method
- Manual update via Edit tool
- Backup created: `.local/2025-12-27-*-pre-research-integration.bak`

---

## [2024-12-26] - Initial Creation

### Created
- Skill created via manual process (pre-creating-skills TDD workflow)
- Category: claude/skill-management
- Type: process
- Purpose: Test-guarded skill updates with compliance validation

### Structure
- 7-phase workflow (RED, Locate, Size Check, Backup, Edit, GREEN, Compliance)
- Progressive disclosure (main workflow + detailed references)
- CLI integration with auditing-skills and fixing-skills

### Verification
- Audit: PASSED
- Line count: 99 lines (well under 500 limit)
## 2026-01-02 - Prevent Placeholder/TODO Generation

**Problem**: Skill updates with detailed prompts produced placeholders instead of real content.

**Changes**:
1. Updated Step 4 (line 74) to explicitly require real content, not placeholders/TODOs
2. Added explicit instructions for "No research" path (lines 130-136)
3. Added explicit instructions for post-research content incorporation (lines 150-155)

**Impact**: Both research paths now have clear directives to populate content from available sources.

**Quality Gate**: Phrase "not placeholders or TODOs" now appears in Step 4.

## 2026-01-03 - Replace researching-skills with orchestrating-research

**Problem**: The skill referenced the older `researching-skills` which provides sequential research. The new `orchestrating-research` skill is superior with parallel execution and intent expansion.

**Changes**:
1. Line 60: Changed "consider using researching-skills" to "consider using orchestrating-research"
2. Line 86: Changed "using `researching-skills` before editing" to "using `orchestrating-research` before editing"
3. Line 120: Updated AskUserQuestion label from "Yes, invoke researching-skills" to "Yes, invoke orchestrating-research"
4. Line 141: Changed skill invocation from `skill: "researching-skills"` to `skill: "orchestrating-research"`
5. Lines 144-149: Updated skill capabilities description to reflect:
   - Intent expansion (handles vague update topics)
   - Parallel research across 6 sources (vs sequential)
   - Cross-source conflict detection
   - Comprehensive SYNTHESIS.md with actionable findings
6. Lines 151-154: Added explicit instruction to read ${OUTPUT_DIR}/SYNTHESIS.md after research completes
7. Line 191: Updated Related Skills section to reference `orchestrating-research` instead of `researching-skills`

**Rationale**: orchestrating-research provides parallel execution and intent expansion, making research faster and more comprehensive for skill updates.

**Impact**: Users now get better research results with parallel source execution and vague query handling.

**Quality Gate**: All references to `researching-skills` have been replaced with `orchestrating-research`.

## 2026-01-03 - Add Workflow Continuation Safeguards

**Problem** (RED): Workflow could stop after Step 3.5 (orchestrating-research) due to ambiguous continuation instructions. When updating-skills invokes orchestrating-research, the assistant may interpret "Then proceed to Step 4 with this content" as "tell the user about the content, then proceed when they confirm" rather than "immediately continue without user interaction".

**Root Cause**: Lines 151-157 told what TO DO after research but lacked explicit "DO NOT" warnings to prevent the assistant from reporting results and waiting for user continuation.

**Changes** (GREEN):
1. **Added new section "Workflow Continuation Rules"** (lines 53-61) AFTER Step 0 and BEFORE Step 1:
   - Explicit rule: "7 steps run automatically Step 1 → 7. ONLY stop for: AskUserQuestion (research decision), Step 5 GREEN verification approval, Step 7 REFACTOR pressure tests"
   - Visual WRONG ❌ vs RIGHT ✅ example showing the premature stop pattern
   - Key principle: "Subskills are steps, not endpoints. Parent workflow continues automatically after child returns"

2. **Replaced "After orchestrating-research completes" section** (lines 164-180) with explicit DO/DO NOT checklist:
   - ✅ DO (immediately, without user input): Read SYNTHESIS.md, extract patterns, incorporate findings, proceed directly to Step 4, continue through Steps 5-7 automatically
   - ❌ DO NOT: Report "Research complete!", summarize and wait for user, stop workflow execution, update todo list showing all tasks completed
   - Added reminder: "Research is Step 3.5 of a 7-step workflow, not the final step"

3. **Updated Success Criteria section** (line 198): Added note "Automatic Completion: All success criteria should be achieved in a single continuous workflow without stopping for user continuation prompts between steps"

**Impact**: Prevents premature workflow termination after research. Ensures automatic continuation from Step 3.5 → 4 → 5 → 6 → 7 without user intervention.

**Verification**: Test by running `/skill-manager update some-existing-skill 'Add new section about X - research the latest patterns first'` and selecting "Yes, invoke orchestrating-research". Workflow should continue automatically through all steps without stopping after research.

**Quality Gate**: Explicit DO/DO NOT continuation rules now present at lines 166-178 with visual examples at lines 57-58.


## [2026-01-03] - Delete Orphaned TypeScript Infrastructure

### Context

The updating-skills TypeScript (scripts/) was orphaned and unused:
- SKILL.md already instruction-based (no npm/CLI references)
- Actual CHANGELOGs use complex format with sections (## [date] - title, ### Changed, ### Reason)
- TypeScript created simple format (`- **date**: desc`) that doesn't match reality
- Workflows operate instruction-based via update-workflow.md

### Changed

**Deleted scripts/ directory:**
- package.json, package-lock.json
- tsconfig.json
- src/update.ts (~500 lines TypeScript)
- node_modules/
- All TypeScript infrastructure

**No SKILL.md changes needed:**
- Already instruction-based (no npm/CLI refs)
- References update-workflow.md which documents actual changelog format
- References context7-refresh.md which documents staleness detection

### Preserved

**All documentation:**
- SKILL.md - Complete TDD update workflow
- references/update-workflow.md - Actual changelog format documented
- references/context7-refresh.md - Context7 staleness logic documented
- references/backup-strategy.md, tdd-methodology.md, etc.

**Supporting directories:**
- .history/ - Changelog preserved
- .local/ - Backups preserved

### Verification

Evidence TypeScript was unused:
1. SKILL.md has 0 npm/CLI references (already instruction-based)
2. Actual CHANGELOGs (auditing-skills, fixing-skills, updating-skills) all use complex format
3. TypeScript format doesn't match any real CHANGELOG in the codebase
4. Workflows reference update-workflow.md, not TypeScript

### Impact

**Positive:**
- Removed unused code (~30KB)
- Simpler architecture (markdown documentation only)
- No maintenance burden
- update-workflow.md is source of truth

**No breaking changes:**
- Workflows already operated instruction-based
- Documentation already captured all logic
- No CLI commands to migrate

### Method

- Updated via updating-skills workflow (self-update)
- No backup needed (no SKILL.md changes)
- Deleted orphaned scripts/ directory
- Changelog documents migration

## [2026-01-12] - Research incorporation verification gate

### Changed

- Step 5 expanded into sub-steps (5.1-5.5) with TodoWrite tracking for each file
- Added verification gate (Step 5.5) requiring explicit confirmation before Step 6 (GREEN)
- Added research-to-update-target mapping tables in update-workflow.md Phase 4c
- Added guidance for updating existing reference files with staleness checks
- Added 5 rationalization counters for partial update patterns
- Integrated Context7 staleness check into Step 4 research decision flow
- Removed separate Context7 Documentation Refresh section (now integrated)

### Reason

- RED failure: Agents marked 'Edit skill with research findings' complete after superficial SKILL.md changes
- References/ files remained stale with outdated information
- No verification that research was actually incorporated
- No mapping from SYNTHESIS.md sections to update targets
- Step 5 was too vague - didn't enumerate which files to update

### Impact

- Forces granular per-file tracking in TodoWrite (prevents bulk completion)
- Blocks progression to GREEN until verification checklist passes
- Provides explicit mapping: SYNTHESIS.md sections → SKILL.md/references/ targets
- Enables comprehensive research incorporation across entire skill directory
- Prevents "SKILL.md only" updates that leave references stale
- Improves research workflow continuity with clear post-research resume point

### Files Modified

1. SKILL.md - Quick Reference table (added Steps 5.1-5.5), Step 5 expansion with verification gate
2. references/update-workflow.md - Added Phase 4c with mapping tables and reference update procedures
3. references/rationalization-table.md - Added 5 research incorporation rationalization counters

### Compliance

- SKILL.md: 318 lines (under 500 limit ✅)
- update-workflow.md: 498 lines
- All reference files exist and resolve
- All external links valid
- Tables formatted with prettier
