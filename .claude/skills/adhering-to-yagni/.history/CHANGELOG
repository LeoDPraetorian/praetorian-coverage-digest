## 2026-01-13 - Add Go-Specific Anti-Patterns

**Changes:**
1. Created new reference file `references/go-anti-patterns.md` with 7 Go-specific YAGNI violations
2. Added Go-Specific Violations table to main SKILL.md for visibility
3. Added reference link in Anti-Patterns section

**New anti-patterns documented:**
- Compile-time interface compliance checks (`var _ Interface = (*Type)(nil)`)
- Version package scaffolding for simple CLIs
- Useless comments that repeat function names
- Empty placeholder types
- Overly generic error types
- Premature interface extraction
- Giant config structs before knowing needs

**Why:**
Julius code review showed these patterns being added without being requested:
- `var _ types.OutputWriter = (*TableWriter)(nil)` - unnecessary
- `version/version.go` package - unnecessary for simple CLI
- Comments on every function - unnecessary

**Test scenario:**
- User asks to create CLI tool
- backend-developer creates code with interface compliance vars, version package, useless comments
- Expected: None of these unless explicitly requested
- After fix: Go-Specific Violations table makes these explicit YAGNI violations
