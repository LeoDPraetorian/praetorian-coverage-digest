# Changelog

## 2026-01-18 - Initial Creation

**RED Phase Documentation:**

Agent tested without skill on scenario: "How do I optimize React Router navigation performance in my app? Routes are lazy loaded and there's a delay when clicking links."

**Observed gaps:**
- Mentioned `prefetch='intent'` but no explanation of other modes ('none', 'render', 'viewport')
- Suggested manual `onMouseEnter` prefetching without explaining when to use vs built-in
- No mention of React Router 7 specifically or evolution of prefetch features
- Generic trade-offs without bandwidth measurements
- No guidance on `navigator.connection` API for respecting user data preferences
- Missing decision tree for "which strategy when?"
- Custom `PrefetchLink` component without comparison to built-in `prefetch` prop
- Suggested `setTimeout(1000ms)` preload but no explanation of delay rationale
- No Chariot-specific prefetch map (assets → vulnerabilities → jobs flow)
- No performance measurement specifics

**Skill addresses these gaps by:**
- Systematic coverage of all 4 prefetch modes with use cases
- Decision tree for strategy selection
- Network condition checks (saveData, effectiveType)
- Route-based prediction map with Chariot examples
- Performance measurement instrumentation
- Integration with Vite code splitting

**Category:** development/frontend
**Skill Type:** Process/Pattern
**Location:** Skill Library (on-demand loading via gateway-frontend)

**Phase 6: Research skipped per user request**

User chose to skip research phase. Content populated from original detailed request including:
- React Router 7 built-in prefetch modes
- Three prefetching strategies (Link/Eager/Prediction)
- Network condition checks
- Chariot-specific examples
- Performance measurement

**Reference files created (7 files, 1497 total lines):**
- link-prefetch-pattern.md (95 lines)
- eager-loading-pattern.md (169 lines)
- route-prediction-pattern.md (253 lines)
- implementation-checklist.md (253 lines)
- network-conditions.md (171 lines)
- performance-measurement.md (287 lines)
- code-splitting-integration.md (269 lines)

**Gateway update:** Added to gateway-frontend routing table with triggers: "prefetch", "route loading", "navigation delay"

**Phase 9: REFACTOR Phase - Pressure testing**

Pressure testing skipped per pressure-testing-skill-content guidance.

**Rationale:** This skill is a reference/pattern skill without enforcement requirements:
- Provides "how-to" guidance, not mandatory process
- No compliance costs for agents to bypass
- No discipline requirements (like TDD or verification-before-completion)
- Agents benefit from using it (helps answer questions accurately)

Falls into "Don't test" category: "Pure reference skills without rules to violate"

**GREEN phase verification sufficient:** Agent successfully used skill to provide systematic guidance with decision trees, network checks, and verification steps (Phase 8.1 confirmed behavioral improvement over RED phase).
